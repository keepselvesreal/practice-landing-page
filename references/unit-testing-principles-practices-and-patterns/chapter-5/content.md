Mocks and test fragility
Chapter 4 introduced a frame of reference that you can use to analyze specific tests
and unit testing approaches. In this chapter, you’ll see that frame of reference in
action; we’ll use it to dissect the topic of mocks.
 The use of mocks in tests is a controversial subject. Some people argue that
mocks are a great tool and apply them in most of their tests. Others claim that mocks
lead to test fragility and try not to use them at all. As the saying goes, the truth lies
somewhere in between. In this chapter, I’ll show that, indeed, mocks often result in
fragile tests—tests that lack the metric of resistance to refactoring. But there are still
cases where mocking is applicable and even preferable.
This chapter covers
Differentiating mocks from stubs
Defining observable behavior and implementation 
details
Understanding the relationship between mocks 
and test fragility
Using mocks without compromising resistance 
to refactoring

Differentiating mocks from stubs
 This chapter draws heavily on the discussion about the London versus classical
schools of unit testing from chapter 2. In short, the disagreement between the schools
stems from their views on the test isolation issue. The London school advocates isolat-
ing pieces of code under test from each other and using test doubles for all but
immutable dependencies to perform such isolation.
 The classical school stands for isolating unit tests themselves so that they can be
run in parallel. This school uses test doubles only for dependencies that are shared
between tests.
 There’s a deep and almost inevitable connection between mocks and test fragility.
In the next several sections, I will gradually lay down the foundation for you to see why
that connection exists. You will also learn how to use mocks so that they don’t compro-
mise a test’s resistance to refactoring.
5.1
Differentiating mocks from stubs
In chapter 2, I briefly mentioned that a mock is a test double that allows you to exam-
ine interactions between the system under test (SUT) and its collaborators. There’s
another type of test double: a stub. Let’s take a closer look at what a mock is and how it
is different from a stub.
5.1.1
The types of test doubles
A test double is an overarching term that describes all kinds of non-production-ready,
fake dependencies in tests. The term comes from the notion of a stunt double in a
movie. The major use of test doubles is to facilitate testing; they are passed to the
system under test instead of real dependencies, which could be hard to set up or
maintain.
 According to Gerard Meszaros, there are five variations of test doubles: dummy,
stub, spy, mock, and fake.1 Such a variety can look intimidating, but in reality, they can all
be grouped together into just two types: mocks and stubs (figure 5.1).
1 See xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code (Addison-Wesley, 2007).

All variations of test 
doubles can be categorized into 
two types: mocks and stubs.

CHAPTER 5
Mocks and test fragility
The difference between these two types boils down to the following:
Mocks help to emulate and examine outcoming interactions. These interactions
are calls the SUT makes to its dependencies to change their state.
Stubs help to emulate incoming interactions. These interactions are calls the
SUT makes to its dependencies to get input data (figure 5.2).
All other differences between the five variations are insignificant implementation
details. For example, spies serve the same role as mocks. The distinction is that spies
are written manually, whereas mocks are created with the help of a mocking frame-
work. Sometimes people refer to spies as handwritten mocks.
 On the other hand, the difference between a stub, a dummy, and a fake is in how
intelligent they are. A dummy is a simple, hardcoded value such as a null value or a
made-up string. It’s used to satisfy the SUT’s method signature and doesn’t partici-
pate in producing the final outcome. A stub is more sophisticated. It’s a fully fledged
dependency that you configure to return different values for different scenarios.
Finally, a fake is the same as a stub for most purposes. The difference is in the ratio-
nale for its creation: a fake is usually implemented to replace a dependency that
doesn’t yet exist.
 Notice the difference between mocks and stubs (aside from outcoming versus
incoming interactions). Mocks help to emulate and examine interactions between the
SUT and its dependencies, while stubs only help to emulate those interactions. This is
an important distinction. You will see why shortly. 
5.1.2
Mock (the tool) vs. mock (the test double)
The term mock is overloaded and can mean different things in different circum-
stances. I mentioned in chapter 2 that people often use this term to mean any test
double, whereas mocks are only a subset of test doubles. But there’s another meaning

Sending an email is 
an outcoming interaction: an inter-
action that results in a side effect 
in the SMTP server. A test double 
emulating such an interaction is 
a mock. Retrieving data from the 
database is an incoming inter-
action; it doesn’t result in a 
side effect. The corresponding 
test double is a stub.

Differentiating mocks from stubs
for the term mock. You can refer to the classes from mocking libraries as mocks, too.
These classes help you create actual mocks, but they themselves are not mocks per se.
The following listing shows an example.
[Fact]
public void Sending_a_greetings_email()
{
var mock = new Mock<IEmailGateway>();      
var sut = new Controller(mock.Object);
sut.GreetUser("user@email.com");
mock.Verify(
   
x => x.SendGreetingsEmail(   
"user@email.com"),
   
Times.Once);
   
}
The test in listing 5.1 uses the Mock class from the mocking library of my choice
(Moq). This class is a tool that enables you to create a test double—a mock. In other
words, the class Mock (or Mock<IEmailGateway>) is a mock (the tool), while the instance
of that class, mock, is a mock (the test double). It’s important not to conflate a mock (the
tool) with a mock (the test double) because you can use a mock (the tool) to create
both types of test doubles: mocks and stubs.
 The test in the following listing also uses the Mock class, but the instance of that
class is not a mock, it’s a stub.
[Fact]
public void Creating_a_report()
{
var stub = new Mock<IDatabase>();       
stub.Setup(x => x.GetNumberOfUsers())     
.Returns(10);
     
var sut = new Controller(stub.Object);
Report report = sut.CreateReport();
Assert.Equal(10, report.NumberOfUsers);
}
This test double emulates an incoming interaction—a call that provides the SUT with
input data. On the other hand, in the previous example (listing 5.1), the call to Send-
GreetingsEmail() is an outcoming interaction. Its sole purpose is to incur a side
effect—send an email.

5.1.3
Don’t assert interactions with stubs
As I mentioned in section 5.1.1, mocks help to emulate and examine outcoming interac-
tions between the SUT and its dependencies, while stubs only help to emulate incom-
ing interactions, not examine them. The difference between the two stems from the
guideline of never asserting interactions with stubs. A call from the SUT to a stub is not
part of the end result the SUT produces. Such a call is only a means to produce the
end result: a stub provides input from which the SUT then generates the output.
NOTE
Asserting interactions with stubs is a common anti-pattern that leads to
fragile tests.
As you might remember from chapter 4, the only way to avoid false positives and thus
improve resistance to refactoring in tests is to make those tests verify the end result
(which, ideally, should be meaningful to a non-programmer), not implementation
details. In listing 5.1, the check
mock.Verify(x => x.SendGreetingsEmail("user@email.com"))
corresponds to an actual outcome, and that outcome is meaningful to a domain
expert: sending a greetings email is something business people would want the system
to do. At the same time, the call to GetNumberOfUsers() in listing 5.2 is not an out-
come at all. It’s an internal implementation detail regarding how the SUT gathers
data necessary for the report creation. Therefore, asserting this call would lead to test
fragility: it shouldn’t matter how the SUT generates the end result, as long as that
result is correct. The following listing shows an example of such a brittle test.
[Fact]
public void Creating_a_report()
{
var stub = new Mock<IDatabase>();
stub.Setup(x => x.GetNumberOfUsers()).Returns(10);
var sut = new Controller(stub.Object);
Report report = sut.CreateReport();
Assert.Equal(10, report.NumberOfUsers);
stub.Verify(
   
x => x.GetNumberOfUsers(),   
Times.Once);
   
}
This practice of verifying things that aren’t part of the end result is also called over-
specification. Most commonly, overspecification takes place when examining interac-
tions. Checking for interactions with stubs is a flaw that’s quite easy to spot because
tests shouldn’t check for any interactions with stubs. Mocks are a more complicated sub-

Differentiating mocks from stubs
ject: not all uses of mocks lead to test fragility, but a lot of them do. You’ll see why later
in this chapter. 
5.1.4
Using mocks and stubs together
Sometimes you need to create a test double that exhibits the properties of both a
mock and a stub. For example, here’s a test from chapter 2 that I used to illustrate the
London style of unit testing.
[Fact]
public void Purchase_fails_when_not_enough_inventory()
{
var storeMock = new Mock<IStore>();
storeMock
    
.Setup(x => x.HasEnoughInventory(    
Product.Shampoo, 5))
    
.Returns(false);
    
var sut = new Customer();
bool success = sut.Purchase(
storeMock.Object, Product.Shampoo, 5);
Assert.False(success);
storeMock.Verify(
   
x => x.RemoveInventory(Product.Shampoo, 5),  
Times.Never);
   
}
This test uses storeMock for two purposes: it returns a canned answer and verifies a
method call made by the SUT. Notice, though, that these are two different methods:
the test sets up the answer from HasEnoughInventory() but then verifies the call to
RemoveInventory(). Thus, the rule of not asserting interactions with stubs is not vio-
lated here.
 When a test double is both a mock and a stub, it’s still called a mock, not a stub.
That’s mostly the case because we need to pick one name, but also because being a
mock is a more important fact than being a stub. 
5.1.5
How mocks and stubs relate to commands and queries
The notions of mocks and stubs tie to the command query separation (CQS) princi-
ple. The CQS principle states that every method should be either a command or a
query, but not both. As shown in figure 5.3, commands are methods that produce side
effects and don’t return any value (return void). Examples of side effects include
mutating an object’s state, changing a file in the file system, and so on. Queries are the
opposite of that—they are side-effect free and return a value.
 To follow this principle, be sure that if a method produces a side effect, that
method’s return type is void. And if the method returns a value, it must stay side-effect

CHAPTER 5

free. In other words, asking a question should not change the answer. Code that main-
tains such a clear separation becomes easier to read. You can tell what a method does
just by looking at its signature, without diving into its implementation details.
 Of course, it’s not always possible to follow the CQS principle. There are always
methods for which it makes sense to both incur a side effect and return a value. A clas-
sical example is stack.Pop(). This method both removes a top element from the
stack and returns it to the caller. Still, it’s a good idea to adhere to the CQS principle
whenever you can.
 Test doubles that substitute commands become mocks. Similarly, test doubles that
substitute queries are stubs. Look at the two tests from listings 5.1 and 5.2 again (I’m
showing their relevant parts here):
var mock = new Mock<IEmailGateway>();
mock.Verify(x => x.SendGreetingsEmail("user@email.com"));
var stub = new Mock<IDatabase>();
stub.Setup(x => x.GetNumberOfUsers()).Returns(10);
SendGreetingsEmail() is a command whose side effect is sending an email. The test
double that substitutes this command is a mock. On the other hand, GetNumberOf-
Users() is a query that returns a value and doesn’t mutate the database state. The cor-
responding test double is a stub.

Observable behavior vs. implementation details
5.2
Observable behavior vs. implementation details
Section 5.1 showed what a mock is. The next step on the way to explaining the con-
nection between mocks and test fragility is diving into what causes such fragility.
 As you might remember from chapter 4, test fragility corresponds to the second
attribute of a good unit test: resistance to refactoring. (As a reminder, the four attri-
butes are protection against regressions, resistance to refactoring, fast feedback, and
maintainability.) The metric of resistance to refactoring is the most important
because whether a unit test possesses this metric is mostly a binary choice. Thus, it’s
good to max out this metric to the extent that the test still remains in the realm of unit
testing and doesn’t transition to the category of end-to-end testing. The latter, despite
being the best at resistance to refactoring, is generally much harder to maintain.
 In chapter 4, you also saw that the main reason tests deliver false positives (and thus
fail at resistance to refactoring) is because they couple to the code’s implementation
details. The only way to avoid such coupling is to verify the end result the code produces
(its observable behavior) and distance tests from implementation details as much as pos-
sible. In other words, tests must focus on the whats, not the hows. So, what exactly is an
implementation detail, and how is it different from an observable behavior?
5.2.1
Observable behavior is not the same as a public API
All production code can be categorized along two dimensions:
Public API vs. private API (where API means application programming interface)
Observable behavior vs. implementation details 
The categories in these dimensions don’t overlap. A method can’t belong to both a pub-
lic and a private API; it’s either one or the other. Similarly, the code is either an internal
implementation detail or part of the system’s observable behavior, but not both.
 Most programming languages provide a simple mechanism to differentiate between
the code base’s public and private APIs. For example, in C#, you can mark any mem-
ber in a class with the private keyword, and that member will be hidden from the cli-
ent code, becoming part of the class’s private API. The same is true for classes: you can
easily make them private by using the private or internal keyword.
 The distinction between observable behavior and internal implementation details
is more nuanced. For a piece of code to be part of the system’s observable behavior, it
has to do one of the following things:
Expose an operation that helps the client achieve one of its goals. An operation is
a method that performs a calculation or incurs a side effect or both.
Expose a state that helps the client achieve one of its goals. State is the current
condition of the system.
Any code that does neither of these two things is an implementation detail.
 Notice that whether the code is observable behavior depends on who its client is
and what the goals of that client are. In order to be a part of observable behavior, the


---
**Page 100**

100
CHAPTER 5
Mocks and test fragility
code needs to have an immediate connection to at least one such goal. The word client
can refer to different things depending on where the code resides. The common
examples are client code from the same code base, an external application, or the
user interface.
 Ideally, the system’s public API surface should coincide with its observable behav-
ior, and all its implementation details should be hidden from the eyes of the clients.
Such a system has a well-designed API (figure 5.4).
Often, though, the system’s public API extends beyond its observable behavior and
starts exposing implementation details. Such a system’s implementation details leak to
its public API surface (figure 5.5). 
5.2.2
Leaking implementation details: An example with an operation
Let’s take a look at examples of code whose implementation details leak to the public
API. Listing 5.5 shows a User class with a public API that consists of two members: a
Name property and a NormalizeName() method. The class also has an invariant: users’
names must not exceed 50 characters and should be truncated otherwise.
public class User
{
public string Name { get; set; }

public string NormalizeName(string name)
{
string result = (name ?? "").Trim();
if (result.Length > 50)
return result.Substring(0, 50);
return result;
}
}
public class UserController
{
public void RenameUser(int userId, string newName)
{
User user = GetUserFromDatabase(userId);
string normalizedName = user.NormalizeName(newName);
user.Name = normalizedName;
SaveUserToDatabase(user);
}
}
UserController is client code. It uses the User class in its RenameUser method. The
goal of this method, as you have probably guessed, is to change a user’s name.
 So, why isn’t User’s API well-designed? Look at its members once again: the Name
property and the NormalizeName method. Both of them are public. Therefore, in
order for the class’s API to be well-designed, these members should be part of the
observable behavior. This, in turn, requires them to do one of the following two things
(which I’m repeating here for convenience):
Expose an operation that helps the client achieve one of its goals.
Expose a state that helps the client achieve one of its goals.
Only the Name property meets this requirement. It exposes a setter, which is an opera-
tion that allows UserController to achieve its goal of changing a user’s name. The
NormalizeName method is also an operation, but it doesn’t have an immediate con-
nection to the client’s goal. The only reason UserController calls this method is to
satisfy the invariant of User. NormalizeName is therefore an implementation detail that
leaks to the class’s public API (figure 5.6).
 To fix the situation and make the class’s API well-designed, User needs to hide
NormalizeName() and call it internally as part of the property’s setter without relying
on the client code to do so. Listing 5.6 shows this approach.

string result = (name ?? "").Trim();
if (result.Length > 50)
return result.Substring(0, 50);
return result;
}
}
public class UserController
{
public void RenameUser(int userId, string newName)
{
User user = GetUserFromDatabase(userId);
user.Name = newName;
SaveUserToDatabase(user);
}
}
User’s API in listing 5.6 is well-designed: only the observable behavior (the Name prop-
erty) is made public, while the implementation details (the NormalizeName method)
are hidden behind the private API (figure 5.7).

Observable behavior vs. implementation details
NOTE
Strictly speaking, Name’s getter should also be made private, because
it’s not used by UserController. In reality, though, you almost always want to
read back changes you make. Therefore, in a real project, there will certainly be
another use case that requires seeing users’ current names via Name’s getter.
There’s a good rule of thumb that can help you determine whether a class leaks its
implementation details. If the number of operations the client has to invoke on the
class to achieve a single goal is greater than one, then that class is likely leaking imple-
mentation details. Ideally, any individual goal should be achieved with a single operation. In
listing 5.5, for example, UserController has to use two operations from User:
string normalizedName = user.NormalizeName(newName);
user.Name = normalizedName;
After the refactoring, the number of operations has been reduced to one:
user.Name = newName;
In my experience, this rule of thumb holds true for the vast majority of cases where
business logic is involved. There could very well be exceptions, though. Still, be sure
to examine each situation where your code violates this rule for a potential leak of
implementation details. 
5.2.3
Well-designed API and encapsulation
Maintaining a well-designed API relates to the notion of encapsulation. As you might
recall from chapter 3, encapsulation is the act of protecting your code against inconsis-
tencies, also known as invariant violations. An invariant is a condition that should be
held true at all times. The User class from the previous example had one such invari-
ant: no user could have a name that exceeded 50 characters.
 Exposing implementation details goes hand in hand with invariant violations—the
former often leads to the latter. Not only did the original version of User leak its
implementation details, but it also didn’t maintain proper encapsulation. It allowed
the client to bypass the invariant and assign a new name to a user without normalizing
that name first.

CHAPTER 5
Mocks and test fragility
 Encapsulation is crucial for code base maintainability in the long run. The reason
why is complexity. Code complexity is one of the biggest challenges you’ll face in soft-
ware development. The more complex the code base becomes, the harder it is to work
with, which, in turn, results in slowing down development speed and increasing the
number of bugs.
 Without encapsulation, you have no practical way to cope with ever-increasing
code complexity. When the code’s API doesn’t guide you through what is and what
isn’t allowed to be done with that code, you have to keep a lot of information in mind
to make sure you don’t introduce inconsistencies with new code changes. This brings
an additional mental burden to the process of programming. Remove as much of that
burden from yourself as possible. You cannot trust yourself to do the right thing all the
time—so, eliminate the very possibility of doing the wrong thing. The best way to do so is to
maintain proper encapsulation so that your code base doesn’t even provide an option
for you to do anything incorrectly. Encapsulation ultimately serves the same goal as
unit testing: it enables sustainable growth of your software project.
 There’s a similar principle: tell-don’t-ask. It was coined by Martin Fowler (https://
martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html) and stands for bundling data with the
functions that operate on that data. You can view this principle as a corollary to the
practice of encapsulation. Code encapsulation is a goal, whereas bundling data and
functions together, as well as hiding implementation details, are the means to achieve
that goal:
Hiding implementation details helps you remove the class’s internals from the eyes
of its clients, so there’s less risk of corrupting those internals.
Bundling data and operations helps to make sure these operations don’t violate
the class’s invariants. 
5.2.4
Leaking implementation details: An example with state
The example shown in listing 5.5 demonstrated an operation (the NormalizeName
method) that was an implementation detail leaking to the public API. Let’s also look
at an example with state. The following listing contains the MessageRenderer class you
saw in chapter 4. It uses a collection of sub-renderers to generate an HTML represen-
tation of a message containing a header, a body, and a footer.
public class MessageRenderer : IRenderer
{
public IReadOnlyList<IRenderer> SubRenderers { get; }
public MessageRenderer()
{
SubRenderers = new List<IRenderer>
{
new HeaderRenderer(),
new BodyRenderer(),
Listing 5.7
State as an implementation detail

new FooterRenderer()
};
}
public string Render(Message message)
{
return SubRenderers
.Select(x => x.Render(message))
.Aggregate("", (str1, str2) => str1 + str2);
}
}
The sub-renderers collection is public. But is it part of observable behavior? Assuming
that the client’s goal is to render an HTML message, the answer is no. The only class
member such a client would need is the Render method itself. Thus SubRenderers is
also a leaking implementation detail.
 I bring up this example again for a reason. As you may remember, I used it to illus-
trate a brittle test. That test was brittle precisely because it was tied to this implementa-
tion detail—it checked to see the collection’s composition. The brittleness was fixed by
re-targeting the test at the Render method. The new version of the test verified the result-
ing message—the only output the client code cared about, the observable behavior.
 As you can see, there’s an intrinsic connection between good unit tests and a well-
designed API. By making all implementation details private, you leave your tests no
choice other than to verify the code’s observable behavior, which automatically
improves their resistance to refactoring.
TIP
Making the API well-designed automatically improves unit tests.
Another guideline flows from the definition of a well-designed API: you should expose
the absolute minimum number of operations and state. Only code that directly helps
clients achieve their goals should be made public. Everything else is implementation
details and thus must be hidden behind the private API.
 Note that there’s no such problem as leaking observable behavior, which would be
symmetric to the problem of leaking implementation details. While you can expose an
implementation detail (a method or a class that is not supposed to be used by the cli-
ent), you can’t hide an observable behavior. Such a method or class would no longer
have an immediate connection to the client goals, because the client wouldn’t be able
to directly use it anymore. Thus, by definition, this code would cease to be part of
observable behavior. Table 5.1 sums it all up.

5.3
The relationship between mocks and test fragility
The previous sections defined a mock and showed the difference between observable
behavior and an implementation detail. In this section, you will learn about hexago-
nal architecture, the difference between internal and external communications, and
(finally!) the relationship between mocks and test fragility.
5.3.1
Defining hexagonal architecture
A typical application consists of two layers, domain and application services, as
shown in figure 5.8. The domain layer resides in the middle of the diagram because
it’s the central part of your application. It contains the business logic: the essential
functionality your application is built for. The domain layer and its business logic
differentiate this application from others and provide a competitive advantage for
the organization.
The application services layer sits on top of the domain layer and orchestrates com-
munication between that layer and the external world. For example, if your applica-
tion is a RESTful API, all requests to this API hit the application services layer first.
This layer then coordinates the work between domain classes and out-of-process
dependencies. Here’s an example of such coordination for the application service. It
does the following:
Queries the database and uses the data to materialize a domain class instance
Invokes an operation on that instance
Saves the results back to the database
The combination of the application services layer and the domain layer forms a hexa-
gon, which itself represents your application. It can interact with other applications,
which are represented with their own hexagons (see figure 5.9). These other applica-
tions could be an SMTP service, a third-party system, a message bus, and so on. A set
of interacting hexagons makes up a hexagonal architecture.

The term hexagonal architecture was introduced by Alistair Cockburn. Its purpose is to
emphasize three important guidelines:
The separation of concerns between the domain and application services layers—Business
logic is the most important part of the application. Therefore, the domain layer
should be accountable only for that business logic and exempted from all other
responsibilities. Those responsibilities, such as communicating with external
applications and retrieving data from the database, must be attributed to appli-
cation services. Conversely, the application services shouldn’t contain any busi-
ness logic. Their responsibility is to adapt the domain layer by translating the
incoming requests into operations on domain classes and then persisting the
results or returning them back to the caller. You can view the domain layer as a
collection of the application’s domain knowledge (how-to’s) and the application
services layer as a set of business use cases (what-to’s).
Communications inside your application—Hexagonal architecture prescribes a
one-way flow of dependencies: from the application services layer to the domain
layer. Classes inside the domain layer should only depend on each other; they
should not depend on classes from the application services layer. This guideline
flows from the previous one. The separation of concerns between the applica-
tion services layer and the domain layer means that the former knows about the
latter, but the opposite is not true. The domain layer should be fully isolated
from the external world.
Communications between applications—External applications connect to your
application through a common interface maintained by the application services
layer. No one has a direct access to the domain layer. Each side in a hexagon
represents a connection into or out of the application. Note that although a

CHAPTER 5

hexagon has six sides, it doesn’t mean your application can only connect to six
other applications. The number of connections is arbitrary. The point is that
there can be many such connections.
Each layer of your application exhibits observable behavior and contains its own set of
implementation details. For example, observable behavior of the domain layer is the
sum of this layer’s operations and state that helps the application service layer achieve
at least one of its goals. The principles of a well-designed API have a fractal nature:
they apply equally to as much as a whole layer or as little as a single class.
 When you make each layer’s API well-designed (that is, hide its implementation
details), your tests also start to have a fractal structure; they verify behavior that helps
achieve the same goals but at different levels. A test covering an application service
checks to see how this service attains an overarching, coarse-grained goal posed by the
external client. At the same time, a test working with a domain class verifies a subgoal
that is part of that greater goal (figure 5.10).
You might remember from previous chapters how I mentioned that you should be
able to trace any test back to a particular business requirement. Each test should tell a
story that is meaningful to a domain expert, and if it doesn’t, that’s a strong indication
that the test couples to implementation details and therefore is brittle. I hope now you
can see why.
 Observable behavior flows inward from outer layers to the center. The overarching
goal posed by the external client gets translated into subgoals achieved by individual

Tests working with different layers have a fractal nature: they verify the 
same behavior at different levels. A test of an application service checks to see how 
the overall business use case is executed. A test working with a domain class verifies 
an intermediate subgoal on the way to use-case completion.

domain classes. Each piece of observable behavior in the domain layer therefore pre-
serves the connection to a particular business use case. You can trace this connection
recursively from the innermost (domain) layer outward to the application services
layer and then to the needs of the external client. This traceability follows from the
definition of observable behavior. For a piece of code to be part of observable behav-
ior, it needs to help the client achieve one of its goals. For a domain class, the client is
an application service; for the application service, it’s the external client itself.
 Tests that verify a code base with a well-designed API also have a connection to
business requirements because those tests tie to the observable behavior only. A good
example is the User and UserController classes from listing 5.6 (I’m repeating the
code here for convenience).
public class User
{
private string _name;
public string Name
{
get => _name;
set => _name = NormalizeName(value);
}
private string NormalizeName(string name)
{
/* Trim name down to 50 characters */
}
}
public class UserController
{
public void RenameUser(int userId, string newName)
{
User user = GetUserFromDatabase(userId);
user.Name = newName;
SaveUserToDatabase(user);
}
}
UserController in this example is an application service. Assuming that the exter-
nal client doesn’t have a specific goal of normalizing user names, and all names are
normalized solely due to restrictions from the application itself, the NormalizeName
method in the User class can’t be traced to the client’s needs. Therefore, it’s an
implementation detail and should be made private (we already did that earlier in
this chapter). Moreover, tests shouldn’t check this method directly. They should ver-
ify it only as part of the class’s observable behavior—the Name property’s setter in
this example.
 This guideline of always tracing the code base’s public API to business require-
ments applies to the vast majority of domain classes and application services but less

so to utility and infrastructure code. The individual problems such code solves are
often too low-level and fine-grained and can’t be traced to a specific business use case. 
5.3.2
Intra-system vs. inter-system communications
There are two types of communications in a typical application: intra-system and inter-
system. Intra-system communications are communications between classes inside your
application. Inter-system communications are when your application talks to other appli-
cations (figure 5.11).
NOTE
Intra-system communications are implementation details; inter-system
communications are not.
Intra-system communications are implementation details because the collaborations
your domain classes go through in order to perform an operation are not part of their
observable behavior. These collaborations don’t have an immediate connection to the
client’s goal. Thus, coupling to such collaborations leads to fragile tests.
 Inter-system communications are a different matter. Unlike collaborations between
classes inside your application, the way your system talks to the external world forms
the observable behavior of that system as a whole. It’s part of the contract your appli-
cation must hold at all times (figure 5.12).
 This attribute of inter-system communications stems from the way separate applica-
tions evolve together. One of the main principles of such an evolution is maintaining
backward compatibility. Regardless of the refactorings you perform inside your sys-
tem, the communication pattern it uses to talk to external applications should always
stay in place, so that external applications can understand it. For example, messages
your application emits on a bus should preserve their structure, the calls issued to an
SMTP service should have the same number and type of parameters, and so on.

The relationship between mocks and test fragility
The use of mocks is beneficial when verifying the communication pattern between
your system and external applications. Conversely, using mocks to verify communica-
tions between classes inside your system results in tests that couple to implementation
details and therefore fall short of the resistance-to-refactoring metric.
5.3.3
Intra-system vs. inter-system communications: An example
To illustrate the difference between intra-system and inter-system communications, I’ll
expand on the example with the Customer and Store classes that I used in chapter 2
and earlier in this chapter. Imagine the following business use case:
A customer tries to purchase a product from a store.
If the amount of the product in the store is sufficient, then
– The inventory is removed from the store.
– An email receipt is sent to the customer.
– A confirmation is returned.
Let’s also assume that the application is an API with no user interface.
 In the following listing, the CustomerController class is an application service that
orchestrates the work between domain classes (Customer, Product, Store) and the
external application (EmailGateway, which is a proxy to an SMTP service).
public class CustomerController
{
public bool Purchase(int customerId, int productId, int quantity)

{
Customer customer = _customerRepository.GetById(customerId);
Product product = _productRepository.GetById(productId);
bool isSuccess = customer.Purchase(
_mainStore, product, quantity);
if (isSuccess)
{
_emailGateway.SendReceipt(
customer.Email, product.Name, quantity);
}
return isSuccess;
}
}
Validation of input parameters is omitted for brevity. In the Purchase method, the
customer checks to see if there’s enough inventory in the store and, if so, decreases
the product amount.
 The act of making a purchase is a business use case with both intra-system and
inter-system communications. The inter-system communications are those between
the CustomerController application service and the two external systems: the third-
party application (which is also the client initiating the use case) and the email gate-
way. The intra-system communication is between the Customer and the Store domain
classes (figure 5.13).
 In this example, the call to the SMTP service is a side effect that is visible to the
external world and thus forms the observable behavior of the application as a whole.

The relationship between mocks and test fragility
It also has a direct connection to the client’s goals. The client of the application is the
third-party system. This system’s goal is to make a purchase, and it expects the cus-
tomer to receive a confirmation email as part of the successful outcome.
 The call to the SMTP service is a legitimate reason to do mocking. It doesn’t lead
to test fragility because you want to make sure this type of communication stays in
place even after refactoring. The use of mocks helps you do exactly that.
 The next listing shows an example of a legitimate use of mocks.
[Fact]
public void Successful_purchase()
{
var mock = new Mock<IEmailGateway>();
var sut = new CustomerController(mock.Object);
bool isSuccess = sut.Purchase(
customerId: 1, productId: 2, quantity: 5);
Assert.True(isSuccess);
mock.Verify(
  
x => x.SendReceipt(
  
"customer@email.com", "Shampoo", 5),  
Times.Once);
  
}
Note that the isSuccess flag is also observable by the external client and also needs
verification. This flag doesn’t need mocking, though; a simple value comparison is
enough.
 Let’s now look at a test that mocks the communication between Customer and
Store.
[Fact]
public void Purchase_succeeds_when_enough_inventory()
{
var storeMock = new Mock<IStore>();
storeMock
.Setup(x => x.HasEnoughInventory(Product.Shampoo, 5))
.Returns(true);
var customer = new Customer();
bool success = customer.Purchase(
storeMock.Object, Product.Shampoo, 5);
Assert.True(success);
storeMock.Verify(
x => x.RemoveInventory(Product.Shampoo, 5),
Times.Once);
}

CHAPTER 5
Mocks and test fragility
Unlike the communication between CustomerController and the SMTP service, the
RemoveInventory() method call from Customer to Store doesn’t cross the applica-
tion boundary: both the caller and the recipient reside inside the application. Also,
this method is neither an operation nor a state that helps the client achieve its goals.
The client of these two domain classes is CustomerController with the goal of making
a purchase. The only two members that have an immediate connection to this goal are
customer.Purchase() and store.GetInventory(). The Purchase() method initiates
the purchase, and GetInventory() shows the state of the system after the purchase is
completed. The RemoveInventory() method call is an intermediate step on the way to
the client’s goal—an implementation detail.

The classical vs. London schools of unit testing, 
revisited
As a reminder from chapter 2 (table 2.1), table 5.2 sums up the differences between
the classical and London schools of unit testing.
In chapter 2, I mentioned that I prefer the classical school of unit testing over the
London school. I hope now you can see why. The London school encourages the use
of mocks for all but immutable dependencies and doesn’t differentiate between intra-
system and inter-system communications. As a result, tests check communications
between classes just as much as they check communications between your application
and external systems.
 This indiscriminate use of mocks is why following the London school often results
in tests that couple to implementation details and thus lack resistance to refactoring.
As you may remember from chapter 4, the metric of resistance to refactoring (unlike
the other three) is mostly a binary choice: a test either has resistance to refactoring or
it doesn’t. Compromising on this metric renders the test nearly worthless.
 The classical school is much better at this issue because it advocates for substitut-
ing only dependencies that are shared between tests, which almost always translates
into out-of-process dependencies such as an SMTP service, a message bus, and so on.
But the classical school is not ideal in its treatment of inter-system communications,
either. This school also encourages excessive use of mocks, albeit not as much as the
London school.

5.4.1
Not all out-of-process dependencies should be mocked out
Before we discuss out-of-process dependencies and mocking, let me give you a quick
refresher on types of dependencies (refer to chapter 2 for more details):
Shared dependency—A dependency shared by tests (not production code)
Out-of-process dependency—A dependency hosted by a process other than the pro-
gram’s execution process (for example, a database, a message bus, or an SMTP
service)
Private dependency—Any dependency that is not shared
The classical school recommends avoiding shared dependencies because they provide
the means for tests to interfere with each other’s execution context and thus prevent
those tests from running in parallel. The ability for tests to run in parallel, sequen-
tially, and in any order is called test isolation.
 If a shared dependency is not out-of-process, then it’s easy to avoid reusing it in
tests by providing a new instance of it on each test run. In cases where the shared
dependency is out-of-process, testing becomes more complicated. You can’t instanti-
ate a new database or provision a new message bus before each test execution; that
would drastically slow down the test suite. The usual approach is to replace such
dependencies with test doubles—mocks and stubs.
 Not all out-of-process dependencies should be mocked out, though. If an out-of-
process dependency is only accessible through your application, then communications with such a
dependency are not part of your system’s observable behavior. An out-of-process dependency
that can’t be observed externally, in effect, acts as part of your application (figure 5.14).
 Remember, the requirement to always preserve the communication pattern
between your application and external systems stems from the necessity to maintain
backward compatibility. You have to maintain the way your application talks to external

Mocks and test fragility
systems. That’s because you can’t change those external systems simultaneously with
your application; they may follow a different deployment cycle, or you might simply
not have control over them.
 But when your application acts as a proxy to an external system, and no client can
access it directly, the backward-compatibility requirement vanishes. Now you can deploy
your application together with this external system, and it won’t affect the clients. The
communication pattern with such a system becomes an implementation detail.
 A good example here is an application database: a database that is used only by
your application. No external system has access to this database. Therefore, you can
modify the communication pattern between your system and the application database
in any way you like, as long as it doesn’t break existing functionality. Because that data-
base is completely hidden from the eyes of the clients, you can even replace it with an
entirely different storage mechanism, and no one will notice.
 The use of mocks for out-of-process dependencies that you have a full control over
also leads to brittle tests. You don’t want your tests to turn red every time you split a
table in the database or modify the type of one of the parameters in a stored proce-
dure. The database and your application must be treated as one system.
 This obviously poses an issue. How would you test the work with such a depen-
dency without compromising the feedback speed, the third attribute of a good unit
test? You’ll see this subject covered in depth in the following two chapters. 
5.4.2
Using mocks to verify behavior
Mocks are often said to verify behavior. In the vast majority of cases, they don’t. The
way each individual class interacts with neighboring classes in order to achieve some
goal has nothing to do with observable behavior; it’s an implementation detail.
 Verifying communications between classes is akin to trying to derive a person’s
behavior by measuring the signals that neurons in the brain pass among each other.
Such a level of detail is too granular. What matters is the behavior that can be traced
back to the client goals. The client doesn’t care what neurons in your brain light up
when they ask you to help. The only thing that matters is the help itself—provided by
you in a reliable and professional fashion, of course. Mocks have something to do with
behavior only when they verify interactions that cross the application boundary and
only when the side effects of those interactions are visible to the external world. 
Summary
Test double is an overarching term that describes all kinds of non-production-
ready, fake dependencies in tests. There are five variations of test doubles—
dummy, stub, spy, mock, and fake—that can be grouped in just two types: mocks
and stubs. Spies are functionally the same as mocks; dummies and fakes serve
the same role as stubs.
Mocks help emulate and examine outcoming interactions: calls from the SUT to
its dependencies that change the state of those dependencies. Stubs help

Summary
emulate incoming interactions: calls the SUT makes to its dependencies to get
input data.
A mock (the tool) is a class from a mocking library that you can use to create a
mock (the test double) or a stub.
Asserting interactions with stubs leads to fragile tests. Such an interaction doesn’t
correspond to the end result; it’s an intermediate step on the way to that result,
an implementation detail.
The command query separation (CQS) principle states that every method
should be either a command or a query but not both. Test doubles that substi-
tute commands are mocks. Test doubles that substitute queries are stubs.
All production code can be categorized along two dimensions: public API ver-
sus private API, and observable behavior versus implementation details. Code
publicity is controlled by access modifiers, such as private, public, and
internal keywords. Code is part of observable behavior when it meets one of
the following requirements (any other code is an implementation detail):
– It exposes an operation that helps the client achieve one of its goals. An oper-
ation is a method that performs a calculation or incurs a side effect.
– It exposes a state that helps the client achieve one of its goals. State is the cur-
rent condition of the system.
Well-designed code is code whose observable behavior coincides with the public
API and whose implementation details are hidden behind the private API. A
code leaks implementation details when its public API extends beyond the
observable behavior.
Encapsulation is the act of protecting your code against invariant violations.
Exposing implementation details often entails a breach in encapsulation
because clients can use implementation details to bypass the code’s invariants.
Hexagonal architecture is a set of interacting applications represented as hexa-
gons. Each hexagon consists of two layers: domain and application services.
Hexagonal architecture emphasizes three important aspects:
– Separation of concerns between the domain and application services layers.
The domain layer should be responsible for the business logic, while the
application services should orchestrate the work between the domain layer
and external applications.
– A one-way flow of dependencies from the application services layer to the
domain layer. Classes inside the domain layer should only depend on each
other; they should not depend on classes from the application services layer.
– External applications connect to your application through a common inter-
face maintained by the application services layer. No one has a direct access
to the domain layer.
Each layer in a hexagon exhibits observable behavior and contains its own set of
implementation details.

CHAPTER 5
Mocks and test fragility
There are two types of communications in an application: intra-system and
inter-system. Intra-system communications are communications between classes
inside the application. Inter-system communication is when the application talks
to external applications.
Intra-system communications are implementation details. Inter-system commu-
nications are part of observable behavior, with the exception of external systems
that are accessible only through your application. Interactions with such sys-
tems are implementation details too, because the resulting side effects are not
observed externally.
Using mocks to assert intra-system communications leads to fragile tests. Mock-
ing is legitimate only when it’s used for inter-system communications—commu-
nications that cross the application boundary—and only when the side effects
of those communications are visible to the external world.

Styles of unit testing
Chapter 4 introduced the four attributes of a good unit test: protection against
regressions, resistance to refactoring, fast feedback, and maintainability. These attri-
butes form a frame of reference that you can use to analyze specific tests and unit
testing approaches. We analyzed one such approach in chapter 5: the use of mocks.
 In this chapter, I apply the same frame of reference to the topic of unit testing
styles. There are three such styles: output-based, state-based, and communication-
based testing. Among the three, the output-based style produces tests of the highest
quality, state-based testing is the second-best choice, and communication-based
testing should be used only occasionally.
 Unfortunately, you can’t use the output-based testing style everywhere. It’s only
applicable to code written in a purely functional way. But don’t worry; there are
techniques that can help you transform more of your tests into the output-based
style. For that, you’ll need to use functional programming principles to restructure
the underlying code toward a functional architecture.
This chapter covers

hexagonal architectures

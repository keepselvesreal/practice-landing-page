Refactoring toward
valuable unit tests
In chapter 1, I defined the properties of a good unit test suite:
It is integrated into the development cycle.
It targets only the most important parts of your code base.
It provides maximum value with minimum maintenance costs. To achieve
this last attribute, you need to be able to:
– Recognize a valuable test (and, by extension, a test of low value).
– Write a valuable test.
Chapter 4 covered the topic of recognizing a valuable test using the four attributes:
protection against regressions, resistance to refactoring, fast feedback, and main-
tainability. And chapter 5 expanded on the most important one of the four: resis-
tance to refactoring.
 As I mentioned earlier, it’s not enough to recognize valuable tests, you should also
be able to write such tests. The latter skill requires the former, but it also requires

that you know code design techniques. Unit tests and the underlying code are highly
intertwined, and it’s impossible to create valuable tests without putting effort into the
code base they cover.
 You saw an example of a code base transformation in chapter 6, where we refac-
tored an audit system toward a functional architecture and, as a result, were able to
apply output-based testing. This chapter generalizes this approach onto a wider spec-
trum of applications, including those that can’t use a functional architecture. You’ll
see practical guidelines on how to write valuable tests in almost any software project.
7.1
Identifying the code to refactor
It’s rarely possible to significantly improve a test suite without refactoring the underly-
ing code. There’s no way around it—test and production code are intrinsically con-
nected. In this section, you’ll see how to categorize your code into the four types in
order to outline the direction of the refactoring. The subsequent sections show a com-
prehensive example.
7.1.1
The four types of code
In this section, I describe the four types of code that serve as a foundation for the rest
of this chapter. 
 All production code can be categorized along two dimensions:
Complexity or domain significance
The number of collaborators
Code complexity is defined by the number of decision-making (branching) points in the
code. The greater that number, the higher the complexity.
How to calculate cyclomatic complexity
In computer science, there’s a special term that describes code complexity: cyclo-
matic complexity. Cyclomatic complexity indicates the number of branches in a given
program or method. This metric is calculated as
1 + <number of branching points>
Thus, a method with no control flow statements (such as if statements or condi-
tional loops) has a cyclomatic complexity of 1 + 0 = 1.
There’s another meaning to this metric. You can think of it in terms of the number of
independent paths through the method from an entry to an exit, or the number of tests
needed to get a 100% branch coverage.
Note that the number of branching points is counted as the number of simplest pred-
icates involved. For instance, a statement like IF condition1 AND condition2
THEN ... is equivalent to IF condition1 THEN IF condition2 THEN ... Therefore,
its complexity would be 1 + 2 = 3.

Identifying the code to refactor
Domain significance shows how significant the code is for the problem domain of your
project. Normally, all code in the domain layer has a direct connection to the end
users’ goals and thus exhibits a high domain significance. On the other hand, utility
code doesn’t have such a connection.
 Complex code and code that has domain significance benefit from unit testing the
most because the corresponding tests have great protection against regressions. Note
that the domain code doesn’t have to be complex, and complex code doesn’t have to
exhibit domain significance to be test-worthy. The two components are independent
of each other. For example, a method calculating an order price can contain no con-
ditional statements and thus have the cyclomatic complexity of 1. Still, it’s important
to test such a method because it represents business-critical functionality.
 The second dimension is the number of collaborators a class or a method has. As
you may remember from chapter 2, a collaborator is a dependency that is either
mutable or out-of-process (or both). Code with a large number of collaborators is
expensive to test. That’s due to the maintainability metric, which depends on the size
of the test. It takes space to bring collaborators to an expected condition and then
check their state or interactions with them afterward. And the more collaborators
there are, the larger the test becomes.
 The type of the collaborators also matters. Out-of-process collaborators are a no-go
when it comes to the domain model. They add additional maintenance costs due to
the necessity to maintain complicated mock machinery in tests. You also have to be
extra prudent and only use mocks to verify interactions that cross the application
boundary in order to maintain proper resistance to refactoring (refer to chapter 5 for
more details). It’s better to delegate all communications with out-of-process depen-
dencies to classes outside the domain layer. The domain classes then will only work
with in-process dependencies.
 Notice that both implicit and explicit collaborators count toward this number. It
doesn’t matter if the system under test (SUT) accepts a collaborator as an argument
or refers to it implicitly via a static method, you still have to set up this collaborator in
tests. Conversely, immutable dependencies (values or value objects) don’t count. Such
dependencies are much easier to set up and assert against.
 The combination of code complexity, its domain significance, and the number of
collaborators give us the four types of code shown in figure 7.1:
Domain model and algorithms (figure 7.1, top left)—Complex code is often part of
the domain model but not in 100% of all cases. You might have a complex algo-
rithm that’s not directly related to the problem domain.
Trivial code (figure 7.1, bottom left)—Examples of such code in C# are parameter-
less constructors and one-line properties: they have few (if any) collaborators
and exhibit little complexity or domain significance.
Controllers (figure 7.1, bottom right)—This code doesn’t do complex or business-
critical work by itself but coordinates the work of other components like domain
classes and external applications.

CHAPTER 7
Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
Overcomplicated code (figure 7.1, top right)—Such code scores highly on both
metrics: it has a lot of collaborators, and it’s also complex or important. An
example here are fat controllers (controllers that don’t delegate complex work
anywhere and do everything themselves).
Unit testing the top-left quadrant (domain model and algorithms) gives you the best
return for your efforts. The resulting unit tests are highly valuable and cheap. They’re
valuable because the underlying code carries out complex or important logic, thus
increasing tests’ protection against regressions. And they’re cheap because the code
has few collaborators (ideally, none), thus decreasing tests’ maintenance costs.
 Trivial code shouldn’t be tested at all; such tests have a close-to-zero value. As for
controllers, you should test them briefly as part of a much smaller set of the overarch-
ing integration tests (I cover this topic in part 3).
 The most problematic type of code is the overcomplicated quadrant. It’s hard to
unit test but too risky to leave without test coverage. Such code is one of the main rea-
sons many people struggle with unit testing. This whole chapter is primarily devoted
to how you can bypass this dilemma. The general idea is to split overcomplicated code
into two parts: algorithms and controllers (figure 7.2), although the actual implemen-
tation can be tricky at times.
TIP
The more important or complex the code, the fewer collaborators it
should have.
Getting rid of the overcomplicated code and unit testing only the domain model and
algorithms is the path to a highly valuable, easily maintainable test suite. With this
approach, you won’t have 100% test coverage, but you don’t need to—100% coverage
shouldn’t ever be your goal. Your goal is a test suite where each test adds significant
value to the project. Refactor or get rid of all other tests. Don’t allow them to inflate
the size of your test suite.

Identifying the code to refactor
NOTE
Remember that it’s better to not write a test at all than to write a
bad test.
Of course, getting rid of overcomplicated code is easier said than done. Still, there are
techniques that can help you do that. I’ll first explain the theory behind those tech-
niques and then demonstrate them using a close-to-real-world example. 
7.1.2
Using the Humble Object pattern to split overcomplicated code
To split overcomplicated code, you need to use the Humble Object design pattern.
This pattern was introduced by Gerard Meszaros in his book xUnit Test Patterns: Refac-
toring Test Code (Addison-Wesley, 2007) as one of the ways to battle code coupling, but
it has a much broader application. You’ll see why shortly.
 We often find that code is hard to test because it’s coupled to a framework depen-
dency (see figure 7.3). Examples include asynchronous or multi-threaded execution,
user interfaces, communication with out-of-process dependencies, and so on.
To bring the logic of this code under test, you need to extract a testable part out of it.
As a result, the code becomes a thin, humble wrapper around that testable part: it glues

the hard-to-test dependency and the newly extracted component together, but itself
contains little or no logic and thus doesn’t need to be tested (figure 7.4).
 If this approach looks familiar, it’s because you already saw it in this book. In fact,
both hexagonal and functional architectures implement this exact pattern. As you
may remember from previous chapters, hexagonal architecture advocates for the sep-
aration of business logic and communications with out-of-process dependencies. This
is what the domain and application services layers are responsible for, respectively.
 Functional architecture goes even further and separates business logic from com-
munications with all collaborators, not just out-of-process ones. This is what makes
functional architecture so testable: its functional core has no collaborators. All depen-
dencies in a functional core are immutable, which brings it very close to the vertical
axis on the types-of-code diagram (figure 7.5).

The Humble Object 
pattern extracts the logic out of the 
overcomplicated code, making that 
code so humble that it doesn’t need to

moved into another class, decoupled 
from the hard-to-test dependency.

The functional core in a functional architecture and the domain layer in 
a hexagonal architecture reside in the top-left quadrant: they have few collaborators 
and exhibit high complexity and domain significance. The functional core is closer 
to the vertical axis because it has no collaborators. The mutable shell (functional 
architecture) and the application services layer (hexagonal architecture) belong 
to the controllers’ quadrant.

Identifying the code to refactor
Another way to view the Humble Object pattern is as a means to adhere to the Single
Responsibility principle, which states that each class should have only a single respon-
sibility.1 One such responsibility is always business logic; the pattern can be applied to
segregate that logic from pretty much anything.
 In our particular situation, we are interested in the separation of business logic
and orchestration. You can think of these two responsibilities in terms of code depth
versus code width. Your code can be either deep (complex or important) or wide (work
with many collaborators), but never both (figure 7.6).
I can’t stress enough how important this separation is. In fact, many well-known princi-
ples and patterns can be described as a form of the Humble Object pattern: they are
designed specifically to segregate complex code from the code that does orchestration.
 You already saw the relationship between this pattern and hexagonal and func-
tional architectures. Other examples include the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) and
the Model-View-Controller (MVC) patterns. These two patterns help you decouple
business logic (the Model part), UI concerns (the View), and the coordination between
them (Presenter or Controller). The Presenter and Controller components are humble
objects: they glue the view and the model together.
 Another example is the Aggregate pattern from Domain-Driven Design.2 One of its
goals is to reduce connectivity between classes by grouping them into clusters—
aggregates. The classes are highly connected inside those clusters, but the clusters them-
selves are loosely coupled. Such a structure decreases the total number of communica-
tions in the code base. The reduced connectivity, in turn, improves testability.

Figure 7.6
Code depth versus code width is 
a useful metaphor to apply when you think of 
the separation between the business logic 
and orchestration responsibilities. Controllers 
orchestrate many dependencies (represented as 
arrows in the figure) but aren’t complex on their 
own (complexity is represented as block height). 
Domain classes are the opposite of that.

CHAPTER 7
Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
 Note that improved testability is not the only reason to maintain the separation
between business logic and orchestration. Such a separation also helps tackle code
complexity, which is crucial for project growth, too, especially in the long run. I per-
sonally always find it fascinating how a testable design is not only testable but also easy
to maintain. 
7.2
Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
In this section, I’ll show a comprehensive example of splitting overcomplicated code
into algorithms and controllers. You saw a similar example in the previous chapter,
where we talked about output-based testing and functional architecture. This time, I’ll
generalize this approach to all enterprise-level applications, with the help of the Hum-
ble Object pattern. I’ll use this project not only in this chapter but also in the subse-
quent chapters of part 3.
7.2.1
Introducing a customer management system
The sample project is a customer management system (CRM) that handles user
registrations. All users are stored in a database. The system currently supports only
one use case: changing a user’s email. There are three business rules involved in this
operation:
If the user’s email belongs to the company’s domain, that user is marked as an
employee. Otherwise, they are treated as a customer.
The system must track the number of employees in the company. If the user’s
type changes from employee to customer, or vice versa, this number must
change, too.
When the email changes, the system must notify external systems by sending a
message to a message bus.
The following listing shows the initial implementation of the CRM system.
public class User
{
public int UserId { get; private set; }
public string Email { get; private set; }
public UserType Type { get; private set; }
public void ChangeEmail(int userId, string newEmail)
{
object[] data = Database.GetUserById(userId);    
UserId = userId;
Email = (string)data[1];
Type = (UserType)data[2];
if (Email == newEmail)
return;

object[] companyData = Database.GetCompany();       
string companyDomainName = (string)companyData[0];
int numberOfEmployees = (int)companyData[1];
string emailDomain = newEmail.Split('@')[1];
bool isEmailCorporate = emailDomain == companyDomainName;
UserType newType = isEmailCorporate                       
? UserType.Employee
                       
: UserType.Customer;
                       
if (Type != newType)
{
int delta = newType == UserType.Employee ? 1 : -1;
int newNumber = numberOfEmployees + delta;
Database.SaveCompany(newNumber);        
}
Email = newEmail;
Type = newType;
Database.SaveUser(this);              
MessageBus.SendEmailChangedMessage(UserId, newEmail);       
}
}
public enum UserType
{
Customer = 1,
Employee = 2
}
The User class changes a user email. Note that, for brevity, I omitted simple valida-
tions such as checks for email correctness and user existence in the database. Let’s
analyze this implementation from the perspective of the types-of-code diagram.
 The code’s complexity is not too high. The ChangeEmail method contains only a
couple of explicit decision-making points: whether to identify the user as an employee
or a customer, and how to update the company’s number of employees. Despite being
simple, these decisions are important: they are the application’s core business logic.
Hence, the class scores highly on the complexity and domain significance dimension.
 On the other hand, the User class has four dependencies, two of which are explicit
and the other two of which are implicit. The explicit dependencies are the userId
and newEmail arguments. These are values, though, and thus don’t count toward the
class’s number of collaborators. The implicit ones are Database and MessageBus.
These two are out-of-process collaborators. As I mentioned earlier, out-of-process col-
laborators are a no-go for code with high domain significance. Hence, the User class
scores highly on the collaborators dimension, which puts this class into the overcom-
plicated category (figure 7.7).
 This approach—when a domain class retrieves and persists itself to the database—
is called the Active Record pattern. It works fine in simple or short-lived projects but

CHAPTER 7
Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
often fails to scale as the code base grows. The reason is precisely this lack of separa-
tion between these two responsibilities: business logic and communication with out-of-
process dependencies. 
7.2.2
Take 1: Making implicit dependencies explicit
The usual approach to improve testability is to make implicit dependencies explicit:
that is, introduce interfaces for Database and MessageBus, inject those interfaces into
User, and then mock them in tests. This approach does help, and that’s exactly what
we did in the previous chapter when we introduced the implementation with mocks
for the audit system. However, it’s not enough.
 From the perspective of the types-of-code diagram, it doesn’t matter if the domain
model refers to out-of-process dependencies directly or via an interface. Such depen-
dencies are still out-of-process; they are proxies to data that is not yet in memory. You
still need to maintain complicated mock machinery in order to test such classes,
which increases the tests’ maintenance costs. Moreover, using mocks for the database
dependency would lead to test fragility (we’ll discuss this in the next chapter).
 Overall, it’s much cleaner for the domain model not to depend on out-of-process
collaborators at all, directly or indirectly (via an interface). That’s what the hexagonal
architecture advocates as well—the domain model shouldn’t be responsible for com-
munications with external systems. 
7.2.3
Take 2: Introducing an application services layer
To overcome the problem of the domain model directly communicating with external
systems, we need to shift this responsibility to another class, a humble controller (an
application service, in the hexagonal architecture taxonomy). As a general rule, domain
classes should only depend on in-process dependencies, such as other domain classes,
or plain values. Here’s what the first version of that application service looks like.

public class UserController
{
private readonly Database _database = new Database();
private readonly MessageBus _messageBus = new MessageBus();
public void ChangeEmail(int userId, string newEmail)
{
object[] data = _database.GetUserById(userId);
string email = (string)data[1];
UserType type = (UserType)data[2];
var user = new User(userId, email, type);
object[] companyData = _database.GetCompany();
string companyDomainName = (string)companyData[0];
int numberOfEmployees = (int)companyData[1];
int newNumberOfEmployees = user.ChangeEmail(
newEmail, companyDomainName, numberOfEmployees);
_database.SaveCompany(newNumberOfEmployees);
_database.SaveUser(user);
_messageBus.SendEmailChangedMessage(userId, newEmail);
}
}
This is a good first try; the application service helped offload the work with out-of-
process dependencies from the User class. But there are some issues with this imple-
mentation:
The out-of-process dependencies (Database and MessageBus) are instantiated
directly, not injected. That’s going to be a problem for the integration tests we’ll
be writing for this class.
The controller reconstructs a User instance from the raw data it receives from
the database. This is complex logic and thus shouldn’t belong to the applica-
tion service, whose sole role is orchestration, not logic of any complexity or
domain significance.
The same is true for the company’s data. The other problem with that data is
that User now returns an updated number of employees, which doesn’t look
right. The number of company employees has nothing to do with a specific
user. This responsibility should belong elsewhere.
The controller persists modified data and sends notifications to the message
bus unconditionally, regardless of whether the new email is different than the
previous one.
The User class has become quite easy to test because it no longer has to communicate
with out-of-process dependencies. In fact, it has no collaborators whatsoever—out-of-
process or not. Here’s the new version of User’s ChangeEmail method:

? UserType.Employee

int delta = newType == UserType.Employee ? 1 : -1;
int newNumber = numberOfEmployees + delta;
numberOfEmployees = newNumber;
}
Email = newEmail;
Type = newType;
return numberOfEmployees;
}
Figure 7.8 shows where User and UserController currently stand in our diagram.
User has moved to the domain model quadrant, close to the vertical axis, because it
no longer has to deal with collaborators. UserController is more problematic.
Although I’ve put it into the controllers quadrant, it almost crosses the boundary into
overcomplicated code because it contains logic that is quite complex.

7.2.4
Take 3: Removing complexity from the application service
To put UserController firmly into the controllers quadrant, we need to extract the
reconstruction logic from it. If you use an object-relational mapping (ORM) library
to map the database into the domain model, that would be a good place to which to
attribute the reconstruction logic. Each ORM library has a dedicated place where you
can specify how your database tables should be mapped to domain classes, such as
attributes on top of those domain classes, XML files, or files with fluent mappings.
 If you don’t want to or can’t use an ORM, create a factory in the domain model
that will instantiate the domain classes using raw database data. This factory can be a
separate class or, for simpler cases, a static method in the existing domain classes. The
reconstruction logic in our sample application is not too complicated, but it’s good to
keep such things separated, so I’m putting it in a separate UserFactory class as shown
in the following listing.
public class UserFactory
{
public static User Create(object[] data)
{
Precondition.Requires(data.Length >= 3);
int id = (int)data[0];
string email = (string)data[1];
UserType type = (UserType)data[2];
return new User(id, email, type);
}
}
This code is now fully isolated from all collaborators and therefore easily testable.
Notice that I’ve put a safeguard in this method: a requirement to have at least three
elements in the data array. Precondition is a simple custom class that throws an
exception if the Boolean argument is false. The reason for this class is the more
succinct code and the condition inversion: affirmative statements are more read-
able than negative ones. In our example, the data.Length >= 3 requirement reads
better than
if (data.Length < 3)
throw new Exception();
Note that while this reconstruction logic is somewhat complex, it doesn’t have domain
significance: it isn’t directly related to the client’s goal of changing the user email. It’s
an example of the utility code I refer to in previous chapters.

7.2.5
Take 4: Introducing a new Company class
Look at this code in the controller once again:
object[] companyData = _database.GetCompany();
string companyDomainName = (string)companyData[0];
int numberOfEmployees = (int)companyData[1];
int newNumberOfEmployees = user.ChangeEmail(
newEmail, companyDomainName, numberOfEmployees);
The awkwardness of returning an updated number of employees from User is a sign
of a misplaced responsibility, which itself is a sign of a missing abstraction. To fix this,
we need to introduce another domain class, Company, that bundles the company-
related logic and data together, as shown in the following listing.
public class Company
{
public string DomainName { get; private set; }
public int NumberOfEmployees { get; private set; }
public void ChangeNumberOfEmployees(int delta)
{
Precondition.Requires(NumberOfEmployees + delta >= 0);
NumberOfEmployees += delta;
}
public bool IsEmailCorporate(string email)
{
string emailDomain = email.Split('@')[1];
return emailDomain == DomainName;
}
}
How is the reconstruction logic complex?
How is the reconstruction logic complex, given that there’s only a single branching
point in the UserFactory.Create() method? As I mentioned in chapter 1, there
could be a lot of hidden branching points in the underlying libraries used by the code
and thus a lot of potential for something to go wrong. This is exactly the case for the
UserFactory.Create() method.
Referring to an array element by index (data[0]) entails an internal decision made
by the .NET Framework as to what data element to access. The same is true for the
conversion from object to int or string. Internally, the .NET Framework decides
whether to throw a cast exception or allow the conversion to proceed. All these hid-
den branches make the reconstruction logic test-worthy, despite the lack of decision
points in it. 
Listing 7.4
The new class in the domain layer

Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
There are two methods in this class: ChangeNumberOfEmployees() and IsEmail-
Corporate(). These methods help adhere to the tell-don’t-ask principle I mentioned
in chapter 5. This principle advocates for bundling together data and operations on
that data. A User instance will tell the company to change its number of employees or
figure out whether a particular email is corporate; it won’t ask for the raw data and do
everything on its own.
 There’s also a new CompanyFactory class, which is responsible for the reconstruc-
tion of Company objects, similar to UserFactory. This is how the controller now looks.
public class UserController
{
private readonly Database _database = new Database();
private readonly MessageBus _messageBus = new MessageBus();
public void ChangeEmail(int userId, string newEmail)
{
object[] userData = _database.GetUserById(userId);
User user = UserFactory.Create(userData);
object[] companyData = _database.GetCompany();
Company company = CompanyFactory.Create(companyData);
user.ChangeEmail(newEmail, company);
_database.SaveCompany(company);
_database.SaveUser(user);
_messageBus.SendEmailChangedMessage(userId, newEmail);
}
}
And here’s the User class.
public class User
{
public int UserId { get; private set; }
public string Email { get; private set; }
public UserType Type { get; private set; }

if (Type != newType)
{
int delta = newType == UserType.Employee ? 1 : -1;
company.ChangeNumberOfEmployees(delta);
}
Email = newEmail;

}
}
Notice how the removal of the misplaced responsibility made User much cleaner.
Instead of operating on company data, it accepts a Company instance and delegates
two important pieces of work to that instance: determining whether an email is corpo-
rate and changing the number of employees in the company.
 Figure 7.9 shows where each class stands in the diagram. The factories and both
domain classes reside in the domain model and algorithms quadrant. User has moved
to the right because it now has one collaborator, Company, whereas previously it had
none. That has made User less testable, but not much.
UserController now firmly stands in the controllers quadrant because all of its com-
plexity has moved to the factories. The only thing this class is responsible for is gluing
together all the collaborating parties.

Analysis of optimal unit test coverage
 Note the similarities between this implementation and the functional architecture
from the previous chapter. Neither the functional core in the audit system nor the
domain layer in this CRM (the User and Company classes) communicates with out-of-
process dependencies. In both implementations, the application services layer is
responsible for such communication: it gets the raw data from the filesystem or from
the database, passes that data to stateless algorithms or the domain model, and then
persists the results back to the data storage.
 The difference between the two implementations is in their treatment of side
effects. The functional core doesn’t incur any side effects whatsoever. The CRM’s
domain model does, but all those side effects remain inside the domain model in the
form of the changed user email and the number of employees. The side effects only
cross the domain model’s boundary when the controller persists the User and Company
objects in the database.
 The fact that all side effects are contained in memory until the very last moment
improves testability a lot. Your tests don’t need to examine out-of-process dependen-
cies, nor do they need to resort to communication-based testing. All the verification
can be done using output-based and state-based testing of objects in memory. 
7.3
Analysis of optimal unit test coverage
Now that we’ve completed the refactoring with the help of the Humble Object pat-
tern, let’s analyze which parts of the project fall into which code category and how
those parts should be tested. Table 7.1 shows all the code from the sample project
grouped by position in the types-of-code diagram.
With the full separation of business logic and orchestration at hand, it’s easy to decide
which parts of the code base to unit test.
7.3.1
Testing the domain layer and utility code
Testing methods in the top-left quadrant in table 7.1 provides the best results in cost-
benefit terms. The code’s high complexity or domain significance guarantees great
protection against regressions, while having few collaborators ensures the lowest mainte-
nance costs. This is an example of how User could be tested:

[Fact]
public void Changing_email_from_non_corporate_to_corporate()
{
var company = new Company("mycorp.com", 1);
var sut = new User(1, "user@gmail.com", UserType.Customer);
sut.ChangeEmail("new@mycorp.com", company);
Assert.Equal(2, company.NumberOfEmployees);
Assert.Equal("new@mycorp.com", sut.Email);
Assert.Equal(UserType.Employee, sut.Type);
}
To achieve full coverage, you’d need another three such tests:
public void Changing_email_from_corporate_to_non_corporate()
public void Changing_email_without_changing_user_type()
public void Changing_email_to_the_same_one()
Tests for the other three classes would be even shorter, and you could use parameter-
ized tests to group several test cases together:
[InlineData("mycorp.com", "email@mycorp.com", true)]
[InlineData("mycorp.com", "email@gmail.com", false)]
[Theory]
public void Differentiates_a_corporate_email_from_non_corporate(
string domain, string email, bool expectedResult)
{
var sut = new Company(domain, 0);
bool isEmailCorporate = sut.IsEmailCorporate(email);
Assert.Equal(expectedResult, isEmailCorporate);
}
7.3.2
Testing the code from the other three quadrants
Code with low complexity and few collaborators (bottom-left quadrant in table 7.1) is
represented by the constructors in User and Company, such as
public User(int userId, string email, UserType type)
{
UserId = userId;
Email = email;
Type = type;
}
These constructors are trivial and aren’t worth the effort. The resulting tests wouldn’t
provide great enough protection against regressions.
 The refactoring has eliminated all code with high complexity and a large number
of collaborators (top-right quadrant in table 7.1), so we have nothing to test there,
either. As for the controllers quadrant (bottom-right in table 7.1), we’ll discuss testing
it in the next chapter.

Handling conditional logic in controllers
7.3.3
Should you test preconditions?
Let’s take a look at a special kind of branching points—preconditions—and see whether
you should test them. For example, look at this method from Company once again:
public void ChangeNumberOfEmployees(int delta)
{
Precondition.Requires(NumberOfEmployees + delta >= 0);
NumberOfEmployees += delta;
}
It has a precondition stating that the number of employees in the company should
never become negative. This precondition is a safeguard that’s activated only in
exceptional cases. Such exceptional cases are usually the result of bugs. The only pos-
sible reason for the number of employees to go below zero is if there’s an error in
code. The safeguard provides a mechanism for your software to fail fast and to prevent
the error from spreading and being persisted in the database, where it would be much
harder to deal with. Should you test such preconditions? In other words, would such
tests be valuable enough to have in the test suite?
 There’s no hard rule here, but the general guideline I recommend is to test all pre-
conditions that have domain significance. The requirement for the non-negative
number of employees is such a precondition. It’s part of the Company class’s invariants:
conditions that should be held true at all times. But don’t spend time testing precon-
ditions that don’t have domain significance. For example, UserFactory has the follow-
ing safeguard in its Create method:
public static User Create(object[] data)
{
Precondition.Requires(data.Length >= 3);
/* Extract id, email, and type out of data */
}
There’s no domain meaning to this precondition and therefore not much value in
testing it. 
7.4
Handling conditional logic in controllers
Handling conditional logic and simultaneously maintaining the domain layer free of
out-of-process collaborators is often tricky and involves trade-offs. In this section, I’ll
show what those trade-offs are and how to decide which of them to choose in your
own project.
 The separation between business logic and orchestration works best when a busi-
ness operation has three distinct stages:
Retrieving data from storage
Executing business logic
Persisting data back to the storage (figure 7.10)


---
**Page 170**

170
CHAPTER 7
Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
There are a lot of situations where these stages aren’t as clearcut, though. As we discussed
in chapter 6, you might need to query additional data from an out-of-process depen-
dency based on an intermediate result of the decision-making process (figure 7.11). Writ-
ing to the out-of-process dependency often depends on that result, too.
As also discussed in the previous chapter, you have three options in such a situation:
Push all external reads and writes to the edges anyway. This approach preserves the
read-decide-act structure but concedes performance: the controller will call
out-of-process dependencies even when there’s no need for that.
Inject the out-of-process dependencies into the domain model and allow the business
logic to directly decide when to call those dependencies.
Split the decision-making process into more granular steps and have the controller act
on each of those steps separately.

Handling conditional logic in controllers
The challenge is to balance the following three attributes:
Domain model testability, which is a function of the number and type of collabora-
tors in domain classes
Controller simplicity, which depends on the presence of decision-making (branch-
ing) points in the controller
Performance, as defined by the number of calls to out-of-process dependencies
Each option only gives you two out of the three attributes (figure 7.12):
Pushing all external reads and writes to the edges of a business operation—Preserves
controller simplicity and keeps the domain model isolated from out-of-process
dependencies (thus allowing it to remain testable) but concedes performance.
Injecting out-of-process dependencies into the domain model—Keeps performance and
the controller’s simplicity intact but damages domain model testability.
Splitting the decision-making process into more granular steps—Helps with both per-
formance and domain model testability but concedes controller simplicity.
You’ll need to introduce decision-making points in the controller in order to
manage these granular steps.
In most software projects, performance is important, so the first approach (pushing
external reads and writes to the edges of a business operation) is out of the question.
The second option (injecting out-of-process dependencies into the domain model)
brings most of your code into the overcomplicated quadrant on the types-of-code dia-
gram. This is exactly what we refactored the initial CRM implementation away from. I
recommend that you avoid this approach: such code no longer preserves the separation

There’s no single solution that satisfies all three attributes: controller simplicity, 
domain model testability, and performance. You have to choose two out of the three.

**Page 172**

CHAPTER 7
Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
between business logic and communication with out-of-process dependencies and
thus becomes much harder to test and maintain.
 That leaves you with the third option: splitting the decision-making process into
smaller steps. With this approach, you will have to make your controllers more com-
plex, which will also push them closer to the overcomplicated quadrant. But there are
ways to mitigate this problem. Although you will rarely be able to factor all the com-
plexity out of controllers as we did previously in the sample project, you can keep that
complexity manageable.
7.4.1
Using the CanExecute/Execute pattern
The first way to mitigate the growth of the controllers’ complexity is to use the Can-
Execute/Execute pattern, which helps avoid leaking of business logic from the
domain model to controllers. This pattern is best explained with an example, so let’s
expand on our sample project.
 Let’s say that a user can change their email only until they confirm it. If a user tries
to change the email after the confirmation, they should be shown an error message.
To accommodate this new requirement, we’ll add a new property to the User class.
public class User
{
public int UserId { get; private set; }
public string Email { get; private set; }
public UserType Type { get; private set; }
public bool IsEmailConfirmed               
{ get; private set; }
               
/* ChangeEmail(newEmail, company) method */
}
There are two options for where to put this check. First, you could put it in User’s
ChangeEmail method:
public string ChangeEmail(string newEmail, Company company)
{
if (IsEmailConfirmed)
return "Can't change a confirmed email";
/* the rest of the method */
}
Then you could make the controller either return an error or incur all necessary side
effects, depending on this method’s output.
public string ChangeEmail(int userId, string newEmail)
{
Listing 7.7

Handling conditional logic in controllers
object[] userData = _database.GetUserById(userId);
  
User user = UserFactory.Create(userData);
  
object[] companyData = _database.GetCompany();
  
Company company = CompanyFactory.Create(companyData);   
string error = user.ChangeEmail(newEmail, company);
     
if (error != null)
    
return error;
     
_database.SaveCompany(company);
      
_database.SaveUser(user);
 
_messageBus.SendEmailChangedMessage(userId, newEmail); 
return "OK";
 
}
This implementation keeps the controller free of decision-making, but it does so at
the expense of a performance drawback. The Company instance is retrieved from the
database unconditionally, even when the email is confirmed and thus can’t be changed.
This is an example of pushing all external reads and writes to the edges of a business
operation.
NOTE
I don’t consider the new if statement analyzing the error string an
increase in complexity because it belongs to the acting phase; it’s not part of
the decision-making process. All the decisions are made by the User class, and
the controller merely acts on those decisions.
The second option is to move the check for IsEmailConfirmed from User to the
controller.
public string ChangeEmail(int userId, string newEmail)
{
object[] userData = _database.GetUserById(userId);
User user = UserFactory.Create(userData);
if (user.IsEmailConfirmed)
   
return "Can't change a confirmed email";  
object[] companyData = _database.GetCompany();
Company company = CompanyFactory.Create(companyData);
user.ChangeEmail(newEmail, company);
_database.SaveCompany(company);
_database.SaveUser(user);
_messageBus.SendEmailChangedMessage(userId, newEmail);
return "OK";
}

CHAPTER 7
Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
With this implementation, the performance stays intact: the Company instance is
retrieved from the database only after it is certain that the email can be changed. But
now the decision-making process is split into two parts:
Whether to proceed with the change of email (performed by the controller)
What to do during that change (performed by User)
Now it’s also possible to change the email without verifying the IsEmailConfirmed
flag first, which diminishes the domain model’s encapsulation. Such fragmentation
hinders the separation between business logic and orchestration and moves the con-
troller closer to the overcomplicated danger zone.
 To prevent this fragmentation, you can introduce a new method in User, CanChange-
Email(), and make its successful execution a precondition for changing an email. The
modified version in the following listing follows the CanExecute/Execute pattern.
public string CanChangeEmail()
{
if (IsEmailConfirmed)
return "Can't change a confirmed email";
return null;
}
public void ChangeEmail(string newEmail, Company company)
{
Precondition.Requires(CanChangeEmail() == null);
/* the rest of the method */
}
This approach provides two important benefits:
The controller no longer needs to know anything about the process of chang-
ing emails. All it needs to do is call the CanChangeEmail() method to see if the
operation can be done. Notice that this method can contain multiple valida-
tions, all encapsulated away from the controller.
The additional precondition in ChangeEmail() guarantees that the email won’t
ever be changed without checking for the confirmation first.
This pattern helps you to consolidate all decisions in the domain layer. The controller
no longer has an option not to check for the email confirmation, which essentially
eliminates the new decision-making point from that controller. Thus, although the
controller still contains the if statement calling CanChangeEmail(), you don’t need to
test that if statement. Unit testing the precondition in the User class itself is enough.
NOTE
For simplicity’s sake, I’m using a string to denote an error. In a real-
world project, you may want to introduce a custom Result class to indicate
the success or failure of an operation.

Handling conditional logic in controllers
7.4.2
Using domain events to track changes in the domain model
It’s sometimes hard to deduct what steps led the domain model to the current state.
Still, it might be important to know these steps because you need to inform external
systems about what exactly has happened in your application. Putting this responsibil-
ity on the controllers would make them more complicated. To avoid that, you can
track important changes in the domain model and then convert those changes into
calls to out-of-process dependencies after the business operation is complete. Domain
events help you implement such tracking.
DEFINITION
A domain event describes an event in the application that is mean-
ingful to domain experts. The meaningfulness for domain experts is what
differentiates domain events from regular events (such as button clicks).
Domain events are often used to inform external applications about import-
ant changes that have happened in your system.
Our CRM has a tracking requirement, too: it has to notify external systems about
changed user emails by sending messages to the message bus. The current implemen-
tation has a flaw in the notification functionality: it sends messages even when the
email is not changed, as shown in the following listing.
// User
public void ChangeEmail(string newEmail, Company company)
{
Precondition.Requires(CanChangeEmail() == null);
if (Email == newEmail)   
return;
/* the rest of the method */
}
// Controller
public string ChangeEmail(int userId, string newEmail)
{
/* preparations */
user.ChangeEmail(newEmail, company);
_database.SaveCompany(company);
_database.SaveUser(user);
_messageBus.SendEmailChangedMessage(  
userId, newEmail);
  
return "OK";
}
You could resolve this bug by moving the check for email sameness to the controller,
but then again, there are issues with the business logic fragmentation. And you can’t

a message anyway.

**Page 176**

176
CHAPTER 7
Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
put this check to CanChangeEmail() because the application shouldn’t return an
error if the new email is the same as the old one.
 Note that this particular check probably doesn’t introduce too much business logic
fragmentation, so I personally wouldn’t consider the controller overcomplicated if it
contained that check. But you may find yourself in a more difficult situation in which
it’s hard to prevent your application from making unnecessary calls to out-of-process
dependencies without passing those dependencies to the domain model, thus over-
complicating that domain model. The only way to prevent such overcomplication is
the use of domain events.
 From an implementation standpoint, a domain event is a class that contains data
needed to notify external systems. In our specific example, it is the user’s ID and
email:
public class EmailChangedEvent
{
public int UserId { get; }
public string NewEmail { get; }
}
NOTE
Domain events should always be named in the past tense because they
represent things that already happened. Domain events are values—they are
immutable and interchangeable.
User will have a collection of such events to which it will add a new element when the
email changes. This is how its ChangeEmail() method looks after the refactoring.
public void ChangeEmail(string newEmail, Company company)
{
Precondition.Requires(CanChangeEmail() == null);
if (Email == newEmail)
return;
UserType newType = company.IsEmailCorporate(newEmail)
? UserType.Employee
: UserType.Customer;
if (Type != newType)
{
int delta = newType == UserType.Employee ? 1 : -1;
company.ChangeNumberOfEmployees(delta);
}
Email = newEmail;
Type = newType;
EmailChangedEvents.Add(
  
new EmailChangedEvent(UserId, newEmail));  
}
Listing 7.12
User adding an event when the email changes
A new event indicates 
the change of email.


---
**Page 177**

177
Handling conditional logic in controllers
The controller then will convert the events into messages on the bus.
public string ChangeEmail(int userId, string newEmail)
{
object[] userData = _database.GetUserById(userId);
User user = UserFactory.Create(userData);
string error = user.CanChangeEmail();
if (error != null)
return error;
object[] companyData = _database.GetCompany();
Company company = CompanyFactory.Create(companyData);
user.ChangeEmail(newEmail, company);
_database.SaveCompany(company);
_database.SaveUser(user);
foreach (var ev in user.EmailChangedEvents)  
{
  
_messageBus.SendEmailChangedMessage(
  
ev.UserId, ev.NewEmail);
  
}
  
return "OK";
}
Notice that the Company and User instances are still persisted in the database uncondi-
tionally: the persistence logic doesn’t depend on domain events. This is due to the dif-
ference between changes in the database and messages in the bus.
 Assuming that no application has access to the database other than the CRM, com-
munications with that database are not part of the CRM’s observable behavior—they
are implementation details. As long as the final state of the database is correct, it
doesn’t matter how many calls your application makes to that database. On the other
hand, communications with the message bus are part of the application’s observable
behavior. In order to maintain the contract with external systems, the CRM should put
messages on the bus only when the email changes.
 There are performance implications to persisting data in the database uncondi-
tionally, but they are relatively insignificant. The chances that after all the validations
the new email is the same as the old one are quite small. The use of an ORM can also
help. Most ORMs won’t make a round trip to the database if there are no changes to
the object state.
 You can generalize the solution with domain events: extract a DomainEvent base
class and introduce a base class for all domain classes, which would contain a collec-
tion of such events: List<DomainEvent> events. You can also write a separate event
dispatcher instead of dispatching domain events manually in controllers. Finally, in
larger projects, you might need a mechanism for merging domain events before
Listing 7.13

CHAPTER 7
Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
dispatching them. That topic is outside the scope of this book, though. You can read
about it in my article “Merging domain events before dispatching” at http://mng
.bz/YeVe.
 Domain events remove the decision-making responsibility from the controller and
put that responsibility into the domain model, thus simplifying unit testing communi-
cations with external systems. Instead of verifying the controller itself and using mocks
to substitute out-of-process dependencies, you can test the domain event creation
directly in unit tests, as shown next.
[Fact]
public void Changing_email_from_corporate_to_non_corporate()
{
var company = new Company("mycorp.com", 1);
var sut = new User(1, "user@mycorp.com", UserType.Employee, false);
sut.ChangeEmail("new@gmail.com", company);
company.NumberOfEmployees.Should().Be(0);
sut.Email.Should().Be("new@gmail.com");
sut.Type.Should().Be(UserType.Customer);
sut.EmailChangedEvents.Should().Equal(
   
new EmailChangedEvent(1, "new@gmail.com"));  
}
Of course, you’ll still need to test the controller to make sure it does the orchestration
correctly, but doing so requires a much smaller set of tests. That’s the topic of the next
chapter. 
7.5
Conclusion
Notice a theme that has been present throughout this chapter: abstracting away the
application of side effects to external systems. You achieve such abstraction by keeping
those side effects in memory until the very end of the business operation, so that they
can be tested with plain unit tests without involving out-of-process dependencies.
Domain events are abstractions on top of upcoming messages in the bus. Changes in
domain classes are abstractions on top of upcoming modifications in the database.
NOTE
It’s easier to test abstractions than the things they abstract.
Although we were able to successfully contain all the decision-making in the domain
model with the help of domain events and the CanExecute/Execute pattern, you
won’t be able to always do that. There are situations where business logic fragmenta-
tion is inevitable.
 For example, there’s no way to verify email uniqueness outside the controller with-
out introducing out-of-process dependencies in the domain model. Another example
is failures in out-of-process dependencies that should alter the course of the business

Conclusion
operation. The decision about which way to go can’t reside in the domain layer
because it’s not the domain layer that calls those out-of-process dependencies. You will
have to put this logic into controllers and then cover it with integration tests. Still,
even with the potential fragmentation, there’s a lot of value in separating business
logic from orchestration because this separation drastically simplifies the unit test-
ing process.
 Just as you can’t avoid having some business logic in controllers, you will rarely be
able to remove all collaborators from domain classes. And that’s fine. One, two, or
even three collaborators won’t turn a domain class into overcomplicated code, as long
as these collaborators don’t refer to out-of-process dependencies.
 Don’t use mocks to verify interactions with such collaborators, though. These
interactions have nothing to do with the domain model’s observable behavior. Only
the very first call, which goes from a controller to a domain class, has an immediate
connection to that controller’s goal. All the subsequent calls the domain class
makes to its neighbor domain classes within the same operation are implementa-
tion details.
 Figure 7.13 illustrates this idea. It shows the communications between components
in the CRM and their relationship to observable behavior. As you may remember from
chapter 5, whether a method is part of the class’s observable behavior depends on
whom the client is and what the goals of that client are. To be part of the observable
behavior, the method must meet one of the following two criteria:
Have an immediate connection to one of the client’s goals
Incur a side effect in an out-of-process dependency that is visible to external
applications
The controller’s ChangeEmail() method is part of its observable behavior, and so is
the call it makes to the message bus. The first method is the entry point for the exter-
nal client, thereby meeting the first criterion. The call to the bus sends messages to
external applications, thereby meeting the second criterion. You should verify both of

these method calls (which is the topic of the next chapter). However, the subsequent
call from the controller to User doesn’t have an immediate connection to the goals of
the external client. That client doesn’t care how the controller decides to implement
the change of email as long as the final state of the system is correct and the call to the
message bus is in place. Therefore, you shouldn’t verify calls the controller makes to
User when testing that controller’s behavior.
 When you step one level down the call stack, you get a similar situation. Now it’s
the controller who is the client, and the ChangeEmail method in User has an immedi-
ate connection to that client’s goal of changing the user email and thus should be
tested. But the subsequent calls from User to Company are implementation details
from the controller’s point of view. Therefore, the test that covers the ChangeEmail
method in User shouldn’t verify what methods User calls on Company. The same line
of reasoning applies when you step one more level down and test the two methods in
Company from User’s point of view.
 Think of the observable behavior and implementation details as onion layers. Test
each layer from the outer layer’s point of view, and disregard how that layer talks to
the underlying layers. As you peel these layers one by one, you switch perspective:
what previously was an implementation detail now becomes an observable behavior,
which you then cover with another set of tests. 
Summary
Code complexity is defined by the number of decision-making points in the
code, both explicit (made by the code itself) and implicit (made by the libraries
the code uses).
Domain significance shows how significant the code is for the problem domain
of your project. Complex code often has high domain significance and vice
versa, but not in 100% of all cases.
Complex code and code that has domain significance benefit from unit test-
ing the most because the corresponding tests have greater protection against
regressions.
Unit tests that cover code with a large number of collaborators have high
maintenance costs. Such tests require a lot of space to bring collaborators to
an expected condition and then check their state or interactions with them
afterward.
All production code can be categorized into four types of code by its complexity
or domain significance and the number of collaborators:
– Domain model and algorithms (high complexity or domain significance, few
collaborators) provide the best return on unit testing efforts.
– Trivial code (low complexity and domain significance, few collaborators)
isn’t worth testing at all.

Summary
– Controllers (low complexity and domain significance, large number of col-
laborators) should be tested briefly by integration tests.
– Overcomplicated code (high complexity or domain significance, large num-
ber of collaborators) should be split into controllers and complex code.
The more important or complex the code is, the fewer collaborators it should
have.
The Humble Object pattern helps make overcomplicated code testable by
extracting business logic out of that code into a separate class. As a result, the
remaining code becomes a controller—a thin, humble wrapper around the busi-
ness logic.
The hexagonal and functional architectures implement the Humble Object
pattern. Hexagonal architecture advocates for the separation of business logic and
communications with out-of-process dependencies. Functional architecture sepa-
rates business logic from communications with all collaborators, not just out-of-
process ones.
Think of the business logic and orchestration responsibilities in terms of code
depth versus code width. Your code can be either deep (complex or important)
or wide (work with many collaborators), but never both.
Test preconditions if they have a domain significance; don’t test them otherwise.
There are three important attributes when it comes to separating business logic
from orchestration:
– Domain model testability—A function of the number and the type of collabora-
tors in domain classes
– Controller simplicity—Depends on the presence of decision-making points in
the controller
– Performance—Defined by the number of calls to out-of-process dependencies
You can have a maximum of two of these three attributes at any given moment:
– Pushing all external reads and writes to the edges of a business operation—Preserves
controller simplicity and keeps the domain model testability, but concedes
performance
– Injecting out-of-process dependencies into the domain model—Keeps performance
and the controller’s simplicity, but damages domain model testability
– Splitting the decision-making process into more granular steps—Preserves perfor-
mance and domain model testability, but gives up controller simplicity
Splitting the decision-making process into more granular steps—Is a trade-off with the
best set of pros and cons. You can mitigate the growth of controller complexity
using the following two patterns:
– The CanExecute/Execute pattern introduces a CanDo() for each Do() method
and makes its successful execution a precondition for Do(). This pattern
essentially eliminates the controller’s decision-making because there’s no
option not to call CanDo() before Do().

CHAPTER 7
Refactoring toward valuable unit tests
– Domain events help track important changes in the domain model, and then
convert those changes to calls to out-of-process dependencies. This pattern
removes the tracking responsibility from the controller.
It’s easier to test abstractions than the things they abstract. Domain events are
abstractions on top of upcoming calls to out-of-process dependencies. Changes
in domain classes are abstractions on top of upcoming modifications in the
data storage.

Part 3
Integration testing
Have you ever been in a situation where all the unit tests pass but the
application still doesn’t work? Validating software components in isolation from
each other is important, but it’s equally important to check how those compo-
nents work in integration with external systems. This is where integration testing
comes into play.
 In chapter 8, we’ll look at integration testing in general and revisit the Test
Pyramid concept. You’ll learn the trade-offs inherent to integration testing and
how to navigate them. Chapters 9 and 10 will then discuss more specific topics.
Chapter 9 will teach you how to get the most out of your mocks. Chapter 10 is a
deep dive into working with relational databases in tests.

Why integration testing?
You can never be sure your system works as a whole if you rely on unit tests exclu-
sively. Unit tests are great at verifying business logic, but it’s not enough to check
that logic in a vacuum. You have to validate how different parts of it integrate with
each other and external systems: the database, the message bus, and so on.
 In this chapter, you’ll learn the role of integration tests: when you should apply
them and when it’s better to rely on plain old unit tests or even other techniques
such as the Fail Fast principle. You will see which out-of-process dependencies to
use as-is in integration tests and which to replace with mocks. You will also see inte-
gration testing best practices that will help improve the health of your code base in
general: making domain model boundaries explicit, reducing the number of layers
in the application, and eliminating circular dependencies. Finally, you’ll learn why
interfaces with a single implementation should be used sporadically, and how and
when to test logging functionality.

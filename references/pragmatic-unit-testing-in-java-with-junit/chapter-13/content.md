CHAPTER 13
Keeping AI Honest with Unit Tests
You’ve learned a number of benefits you can gain from writing unit tests:
fewer defects, of course, but also trustworthy documentation, the ability to
keep your code clean through refactoring, and a dramatic increase in confi-
dence for shipping the system.
AI can generate code, creating increasingly dramatic implications for the
software development industry and you. Yet, unit testing can and will provide
tremendous value in your software development efforts. In this chapter, you’ll
take an approach involving AI generation of both production code and unit
tests. You’ll discover why unit tests remain essential, and you’ll learn how to
incorporate them into a workflow that will give you the confidence to ship.
AI Isn’t Going Away
By the time you read this chapter, the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI)
will have advanced, perhaps significantly, from when I wrote it (January
2024). At some future point, very possibly within the span of your career,
most (not all) software will be generated by AI.
You will still need to tell your AI assistant what to do.
Today, AI-generated code has limitations. It’s of dubious quality, for one—very
stepwise and highly concrete. Maybe when AI evolves to a point where the
code always works as expected, its quality won’t matter because, at that point,
you might never have to read or write another word of code again. But today,
AI-generated code may contain defects. ChatGPT, for example, perpetually
admits that fact:
ChatGPT can make mistakes. Consider checking important information.
I’ve seen failures often occur when an LLM (Large Language Model) adds a
new feature to an existing body of code, for example. You’ll explore how to

help your LLM do a better job with that challenge in this chapter. But left to
its own devices, an LLM is increasingly likely to break existing functionality
as it adds new increments.
Do not trust any AI-generated code to be correct.
I’ve been pleasantly surprised, though: more often than not, the code LLMs
(including ChatGPT, Meta.ai, and Claude) have produced for me has been
correct. But I’ve also seen them generate enough wrong code to know that I
could never fully depend on it.
From these limitations arises a critical need: if you’re going to use AI tools to
generate code, you’ll need to create and run tests.
Fortunately, you’ve read the rest of this book (right?) and know how to do
just that. Even better, AI will speed you up by coding the tests.
Give the benefit of the doubt to your pair programmer—whether artificial or
human—but assume that you can both make mistakes. доверяй, но проверяй.
(“Trust, but verify.”)
Note: as I write this, you can also use tools like GitHub Copilot, JetBrains AI
Assistant, and Duet to help you develop. These tools sit atop one or more
LLMs and provide what can best be described as AI-assisted code completion.
I highly recommend incorporating them into your regular code development
process. In this chapter, however, you’ll focus on using a test-driven process
for generating code at the class level—with the intent of maximizing the
amount of (verified) code that AI can generate for you.
Exploring a Simple Example with ChatGPT
Interaction with an LLM via prompting is a conversation. That conversation
may play out very differently the next time I have it. As a result, it’s probably
best if this chapter reads as a story about my personal interaction with
ChatGPT on a small example. Accordingly, unlike the rest of the book, this
chapter is written in first-person past tense.
I held my conversation with OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, which at the time
was based on the GPT-4 LLM. My subsequent mentions of ChatGPT refer to
this configuration. While other models may exist that have been trained to be
optimized for programming tasks (Code Llama for example), the experience I

relay in this chapter demonstrates an approach that will work—and will only
get better with time—with virtually any current LLM.
I was responsible for producing an event check-in list. Given a list of attendees, I
needed to write code that sorted them. Attendee names started with a first
name, followed by zero or more “middle” names, followed by the surname or
last name. Some examples:
Jeffrey John Langr
John Jacob Jingleheimer-Schmidt
John Yossarian
Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle
The check-in list needed to show names in alphabetical order based on the last
name, not the first name. I had to “normalize” each name, then, into the form
“Last, First M. I.”:
Langr, Jeffrey J.
Jingleheimer-Schmidt, John J.
Yossarian, John
Doyle, Arthur I. C.
Oh I. C. indeed: the middle names are transformed into initials. Other rules
implicit in these examples include the obvious fact that names are separated
by spaces and that a comma should appear after each last name.
I focused on the task of normalizing a single name, deferring the trivial task
of sorting a list of names. First, however, I wanted to teach my LLM how to
write code to help me and ChatGPT work better together.
Establishing a Java Standard
By default, ChatGPT generates stepwise code that requires too much time to
fully comprehend. I wanted it to do better, so I supplied a prompt describing
the kind of code I wanted:
YOU:
I will be asking you to write Java code. Write all code as Jeff Langr. Jeff
Langr (Jeff) has a specific coding standard. Here are the rules for your standard
for Java language programming, which I will refer to as Jeff-Java when appropriate.
1. Use ‘var‘ when declaring local variables and the compiler allows it.
2. Where possible, prefer use of the streams functionality and implement iterative
operations using stream functions, such as ‘map‘ and ‘filter‘.
3. For any and all complex expressions—mathematics, complex conditionals, pred-
icates, and so on—extract the code to a separate function. This should also hold
true for lambdas within a chained stream expression.

**Page 248**

4. In general, create very short, intention-revealing functions for any complexity.
5. Avoid the use of temporaries in most cases unless there is a strong reason to use
them (for example, to use them more than once within a single expression). Instead,
extract the temporary’s initialization to a separate function with the same name as
the temporary, then inline the temporary to remove it.
ChatGPT affirmed my request:
CHAT-GPT:
Understood! Blah blah blah...
You might wonder why I even bothered telling my LLM to improve the code.
If an LLM can generate the code I need, I shouldn’t have to read it.
However, hearken back to the earlier mentioned limitations of LLMs like
ChatGPT. They’re gonna be wrong at times…just like you and me. You’ll have
to read and manually update some amount of code. Even as that need likely
diminishes over time, keeping your code organized (by predominantly creating
small classes and methods) appears to increase the odds that the LLM-
generated code is correct.
Providing Examples to ChatGPT
Incrementally test driving small, unit behaviors into a system remains the
best choice for humans. For an LLM, maybe not.
I first tried getting ChatGPT to consume all my requirements for the name
normalizer at once. The code was a mess, and it didn’t work. I took the next-
smaller step, which was to first give it a subset containing the four core cases
it needed to cover. I helped ChatGPT focus on what I believe to be a proper
design—one that, in general, is based on small classes and small methods.
With such an improved design, I believe ChatGPT had a much better chance
to correctly generate new increments.
One of the best ways to get good results from an LLM is to provide examples
in your prompts. I followed that advice for the name normalizer after first
describing in English what I wanted. My prompt provided five examples for
four core cases:
YOU:
Write Java code for a feature known as the name normalizer. Given a per-
son’s name, the name normalizer should return the last name first, followed by a
comma, then the first name.
If there is one or more middle names, return the initial of each. The initial is the first
letter followed by a period.
Assume that the name provided to the method is never empty or null.

output: Cohen, Leonard

output: Martin, George R. R.

Unit tests and examples are birds of a feather—remember this tip from
Chapter 10, Streamlining Your Tests, on page 189:
Good tests provide examples of how clients interact with the
system.
Accordingly, I told my LLM to translate the examples into tests:
YOU:
Also, provide JUnit tests for the core cases.
I took a few seconds to vet the tests that ChatGPT generated to ensure that
they correctly aligned with my examples. ChatGPT did a decent job, generating
tests that used the same data as the examples I provided:
utj3-ai/01/src/test/java/util/NameNormalizerTest.java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
public class NameNormalizerTest {

NameNormalizer.normalizeName("George Raymond Richard Martin"));
}
@Test
public void testLongName() {
assertEquals("Hackley, Emma A. S.",
NameNormalizer.normalizeName("Emma Azalia Smith Hackley"));
}
}
ChatGPT got a little confused regarding the tests testMultipleMiddleNames and
testLongName. I had ChatGPT fix this later (as I also did with the unnecessary test
prefix for each test).
ChatGPT did a job (in other words, not a fine one) generating the corresponding
normalizer implementation:
utj3-ai/01/src/main/java/util/NameNormalizer.java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
public class NameNormalizer {
public static String normalizeName(String name) {
var nameParts = name.split(" ");
if (nameParts.length == 1) {
return name;
}
var lastName = nameParts[nameParts.length - 1];
var firstName = nameParts[0];
var middleNames =
Arrays.copyOfRange(nameParts, 1, nameParts.length - 1);
return formatLastNameFirst(lastName, firstName, middleNames);
}

private static String extractInitial(String name) {
return name.charAt(0) + ".";
}
}
Telling Your LLM to Clean Up Its Act
The LLM’s solution passed the tests, and it wasn’t bad, actually, but there
were a few wrinkles to iron out. First, it didn’t include a package name, which
forced me to copy only part of its solution rather than wholesale copy-and-
replace the generated code, which is a lot faster. (I’m imagining a near future
where integration with IDEs is a lot better, and, in fact, I’ve begun building
such a plugin myself.)
Here’s my prompt to tell the LLM to add the package name, as well as smooth
out the aforementioned wrinkles:
YOU:
The code should live in a Java package named util.
The Jeff-Java standard indicates that you should avoid the use of temporaries in
methods, but normalizeName has three temps that should be eliminated.
Do not include the word test in the test name; it is redundant.
Do not use static methods for the implementation. Prefer using instance methods
for generated code.
Update the Jeff-Java standard where appropriate to fix these problems for any code
generated going forward.
ChatGPT did a good job of delivering:
utj3-ai/02/src/test/java/util/NameNormalizerTest.java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

String firstName, String lastName, String[] middleNames) {
var middleInitials = Arrays.stream(middleNames)

String.format("%s, %s %s", lastName, firstName, middleInitials);
}
private String extractInitial(String name) {
return name.charAt(0) + ".";
}
}
And once again, all tests passed.
I disliked a few of its choices, but found the code fairly easy to follow and…
almost good enough. I complained immediately:

YOU:
The arguments to formatLastNameFirst should have first been extracted to new
functions, perhaps named firstName, middleNames, and lastName respectively.
Update the Jeff-Java standard to indicate that the right-hand side of an assignment
should first be extracted to a new function before inlining, if it is anything that
involves "implementation-specific details," i.e., anything that might need to be
explained.
Now we were talking! ChatGPT was doing a pretty good job of listening.

The code was at the point where I could easily reason about exactly what was
going on. It took only a moment to understand any one method and trust
that it did what it said.
I prompted ChatGPT to fix a few more things:
YOU:
Simplify the method named extractInitial to initial.
Move the assertion for "Samuel Leroy Jackson" to a new test initializesMiddleName.
Move the assertion for "Emma Azalia Smith Hackley" to the test multipleMiddleNames.
Eliminate the arguments to formatLastNameFirst. Instead, have its code directly access
the functions firstName, lastName, and middleNames.
ChatGPT complied:
utj3-ai/04/src/test/java/util/NameNormalizerTest.java
@Test
public void initializesMiddleName() {
assertEquals("Jackson, Samuel L.",
normalizer.normalizeName("Samuel Leroy Jackson"));
}

Adding a New Feature: Suffixes
I moved on to the next code increment, again providing an example for the
LLM to translate into a test.
YOU:
Alter both the code and the tests to support suffixes. A suffix appears after
a comma at the end of a name.
Examples
input: Martin Luther King, Jr.
output: King, Martin L., Jr.
Here’s what ChatGPT spewed out:
utj3-ai/05/src/test/java/util/NameNormalizerTest.java
@Test
public void nameWithSuffix() {
assertEquals("King, Martin L., Jr.",
normalizer.normalizeName("Martin Luther King, Jr."));
}
utj3-ai/05/src/main/java/util/NameNormalizer.java
public class NameNormalizer {
private String[] nameParts;
private String suffix = "";
➤
public String normalizeName(String name) {
if (name.contains(",")) {
➤
var parts = name.split(", ");
➤
this.nameParts = parts[0].split(" ");
➤
this.suffix = ", " + parts[1];
➤
} else {
➤
this.nameParts = name.split(" ");
➤
}
➤
➤
if (nameParts.length == 1) {
➤
return name;
➤
}
➤
➤
return formatLastNameFirst() + suffix;
➤
}
// ...
}
That went to pot pretty quickly. It did work, at least for the test case I gave
it, but the code was back to stepwise, intertwined logic that was hard to follow.
Also, ChatGPT seemed to have forgotten my Jeff-Java style rules.

Letting Your LLM Discover Missing Tests
Before I asked ChatGPT to fix the code, I took a little detour. I thought it might
be useful to ask ChatGPT to generate test cases for its own code but in a new
conversation. It produced this:
utj3-ai/05/src/test/java/util/NameNormalizerAITest.java
public class NameNormalizerAITest {
private NameNormalizer normalizer = new NameNormalizer();
@Test
public void testSimpleTwoPartName() {
assertEquals("Doe, John", normalizer.normalizeName("John Doe"));
}
@Test
public void testNameWithMiddleInitial() {
assertEquals("Doe, John A.",
normalizer.normalizeName("John A. Doe"));
}
@Test
public void testNameWithSuffix() {
assertEquals("Doe, John Jr.",
normalizer.normalizeName("John Doe, Jr."));
}
@Test
public void testSingleName() {
assertEquals("John", normalizer.normalizeName("John"));
}
@Test
public void testNameWithMiddleNames() {
assertEquals("Doe, John A. B.",
normalizer.normalizeName("John Adam Bernard Doe"));
}
@Test
public void testEmptyString() {
assertEquals("", normalizer.normalizeName(""));
}
// Optional: If handling null is expected
@Test
public void testNullInput() {
assertEquals(null, normalizer.normalizeName(null));
}
}
The generated test cases were decent, though again, they ignored the Jeff-
Java rule around test names. When I ran them, I discovered two test failures:
Chapter 13. Keeping AI Honest with Unit Tests • 256
report erratum  •  discuss


---
**Page 257**

testNameWithSuffix and testNullInput. I ignored testNullInput since I’d decided the input
to normalizeName couldn’t ever be null.
The other failing test, testNameWithSuffix, involved a two-part name, whereas I’d
only provided a three-part name to ChatGPT as an example. When I copied
the test code for testNameWithSuffix into NameNormalizerTest, it still failed.
ChatGPT indeed had discerned the need for a test case that I’d missed! The
failing test didn’t point out a problem with the code, though—its expected
output for “John Doe, Jr.” was incorrect (it should have been “Doe, John,
Jr.”, with a comma after the first name).
I considered what I knew about iterating via ZOM (see ZOM: Zero and One
Done, Now Testing Many, on page 22) and gave ChatGPT a one-two-three set
of examples.
YOU:
Try again with the following changes.
Alter both the code and the tests to support suffixes. A suffix appears after a comma
at the end of a name.
Examples
input: Madonna, Esq.
output: Madonna, Esq.
input: John Doe, Sr.
output: Doe, John, Sr.
input: Martin Luther King, Jr.
output: King, Martin L., Jr.
Ensure you use the Jeff-Java standard. Most importantly, find a way to keep the
suffix code isolated from as much of the existing code within NameNormalizer as
possible.
Do not include any tests around a null name.
At first glance, the result looked promising:
utj3-ai/06/src/test/java/util/NameNormalizerTest.java
@Test
public void nameWithSuffix() {
assertEquals("King, Martin L., Jr.",
normalizer.normalizeName("Martin Luther King, Jr."));
assertEquals("Doe, John, Sr.",
normalizer.normalizeName("John Doe, Sr."));
}

this.nameParts = parts[0].split(" ");
this.suffix = ", " + parts[1];
} else {
this.nameParts = name.split(" ");
}
}
// ...
}
The AI solution was awkward. The method extractSuffix did extract the suffix,
but it also set a value into nameParts, making the logic much harder to follow.
A better solution would involve a pure function named extractSuffix that does
only that—given a name, return the suffix or empty string.
I ignored the deficiency. ChatGPT was teaching me not to sweat the small
stuff as much—unlike building my own code, where tending to all the
small things speeds me up over time.
It had also become apparent that nitpicking every nuance of what the LLM
produced seemed like it would take hours. I decided I’d prompt ChatGPT to
fix the problem if I needed to revisit the extractSuffix method.
From AI, “good enough to have an easy conversation about” is
good enough.

ChatGPT Breaks the Code
On the surface, the code ChatGPT produced was reasonable, except for the way
it had designed extractSuffix. Alas, I now had a test failure involving poor Madonna.
Expected :Madonna, Esq.
Actual
:Madonna, Madonna, Esq.
“Madonna, Madonna, Esquire?” Sounds like a potential song, maybe a blatant
ripoff of “Vogue.” Maybe I should get ChatGPT to write some lyrics. (I did.)
1
I went with the lazy flow—I asked ChatGPT to fix its mistake. (It broke stuff,
so why should I fix it?) ChatGPT has had the effect of making me lazy, but
maybe that’s the good kind of lazy.
YOU:
Expected :Madonna, Esq.
Actual :Madonna, Madonna, Esq.
See if you can fix the problem.
The LLM had a sense of what was going on and how to fix it:
CHAT-GPT:
The issue with the Madonna-based test case failing is due to how the
normalization logic is applied even when there’s only a single name part before
the suffix, leading to the repetition of the name. To fix this, we need to adjust the
logic to correctly handle cases where there’s only a single name part (i.e., no first
and last name separation, but potentially a suffix).
The fix offered did pass the tests:
utj3-ai/07/src/main/java/util/NameNormalizer.java
public String normalizeName(String name) {
extractSuffix(name);
// Handle case for 1 name w/ no middle names but possible a suffix
if (nameParts.length == 1) {
➤
return nameParts[0] + suffix;
➤
}
➤
return formatLastNameFirst() + suffix;
}
Defects in code are often good at hiding themselves—broken things may look
reasonable. But reasonable isn’t correct.
Don’t ship code just because it looks good.

Getting the LLM to Do Final Design Cleanup
The last thing to tackle was some final code cleanup.
YOU:
The solution works. The method extractSuffix should be reworked, however,
into a pure function (i.e., with no side effects). The side effects, if needed, should
occur in normalizeName.
Also, I just noticed the silliness in formatLastNameFirst. Inline the temporaries, please.
Oh my. I don’t want to show you the abomination it produced, but I suppose
I must. Here’s a small piece of it:
utj3-ai/08/src/main/java/util/NameNormalizer.java
public String normalizeName(String name) {
var extractedResult = extractSuffix(name);
var nameParts = extractedResult[0].split(" ");
var suffix = extractedResult[1];
if (nameParts.length == 1) {
return nameParts[0] + suffix;
}
var middleInitials = Arrays.stream(middleNames(nameParts))
.map(this::initial)
.collect(Collectors.joining(" "));
return (nameParts[nameParts.length - 1] + ", " + nameParts[0] +
(middleInitials.isEmpty() ? "" : " " + middleInitials)) + suffix;
}
I was a little upset at this point. My message to ChatGPT wasn’t very pleasant.
YOU:
Undo that last change. It’s horrible. You inlined the helper functions like
last(). Show me the prior version.
Thankfully, ChatGPT only undid the inlining mess. It retained the conversion
of extractSuffix to a functional method:
utj3-ai/09/src/main/java/util/NameNormalizer.java
public String normalizeName(String name) {
var result = extractSuffix(name);
this.nameParts = result[0].split(" ");
this.suffix = result[1];
if (nameParts.length == 1) {
return nameParts[0] + suffix;
}
return formatLastNameFirst() + suffix;
}

Its new solution clarified to me what ChatGPT was trying to do all along, but
I hadn’t noticed. The extractSuffix method was now returning a tuple—or Java’s
code-heavy version of one—a two-dimensional array containing the base name
and suffix. With modern Java, using a record seemed a better choice.
YOU:
Replace the tuple returned by extractSuffix with a version that uses a Java
record, defined as a nested class within NameNormalizer.

ChatGPT did the job:
utj3-ai/10/src/main/java/util/NameNormalizer.java
private record ExtractedNameParts(String[] nameParts, String suffix) {}
public String normalizeName(String name) {
var extractedNameParts = extractSuffix(name);
this.nameParts = extractedNameParts.nameParts();
this.suffix = extractedNameParts.suffix();
if (nameParts.length == 1) {
return nameParts[0] + suffix;
}
return formatLastNameFirst() + suffix;
}
private ExtractedNameParts extractSuffix(String name) {
if (name.contains(",")) {
var parts = name.split(", ", 2);
return new ExtractedNameParts(parts[0].split(" "), ", " + parts[1]);
} else {
return new ExtractedNameParts(name.split(" "), "");
}
}
I’ll take it. I felt that the code still had numerous little problems, particularly
some bits where the code didn’t declare well what was going on. For example,
what’s nameParts[0]? What’s parts[0]?
But maybe that’s okay. I reminded myself that I wasn’t trying to create “perfect”
code. (As if there was such a thing.)
It is important that an AI solution is composed of focused units. (Huh!) Small,
single-purpose methods allow ChatGPT to employ intention-revealing, accurate
method and variable names. In turn, those small, accurately named concepts
allow both the LLM and you (or me) to continue with a sensible conversation
as you add more increments and fix problems.
For Extra Credit
Start a similar conversation with your LLM of choice to build the name nor-
malizer. Then, see how effective a solution it can produce by prompting a
couple more features.

Harry Truman had a single-letter middle name, sort of, implying that it
should not be abbreviated with a period.
input: Harry S Truman
output: Truman, Harry S

If a person has a salutation, it should precede the first name in the result.
Known salutations include Dr, Mr, Mrs, Ms, Sir, Miss, Lord, and Esq.
Each salutation may optionally be terminated by a period. Retain the
period if it exists.
input: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
output: King, Jr., Dr. Martin L.
input: Sir Patrick Stewart
output: Stewart, Sir Patrick
If you really want to get wild, a version supporting non-Western names would
no doubt involve numerous additional rules.
Increasing Odds of Success with AI-Generated Code
The most important thing to remember when developing software with an LLM
is you can’t trust the code it generates. The skills you obtained in Pragmatic
Unit Testing in Java with JUnit, however, provide you with a basis for verifying
the code. Consider always following the CAX cycle, as demonstrated in this
chapter, for generating code:
• Create both production code and tests when prompting the LLM, using
(ZOM-inclusive) examples as the basis for the tests.
• Assess the fidelity of the generated tests with the examples you provided.
• e*Xecute the tests. Repeat the cycle (with alterations) if they don’t all pass.
Also, provide a small set of programming style guidelines to your LLM to
improve the solution’s design and potentially increase the likelihood of a
correct solution. Jeff-Java style represents a good starting point.
Will I Go Faster?
AI tools are only now emerging from their infancy, but they show a lot of
promise. As with human toddlers, they thrive when you provide them with
some direction and safeguards, but they can also surprise you with their
cleverness, particularly when you let them explore.
Good design makes so many things easier: writing tests around code, under-
standing code, extending code, and so on. Generating code via an LLM is also
easier when you direct it to follow a small set of guidelines for design that
promote small, focused methods and intention-revealing names.

Will using an LLM speed you up? I believe the answer will be increasingly
yes. For now, it will speed you up at least as much as any auto-code-complete
mechanisms speed you up. You’re typing far less, for one.
Personally, I can go considerably faster than an LLM for some pieces of pro-
ducing a solution, particularly around small adjustments to the way I want
the code expressed. But there are many operations that LLMs can do faster
than me. For example, it was quicker to change the array-based tuple to a
record than it would have been by hand. It’s also a lot faster to have the LLM
generate tests from examples.
Maybe my biggest speed-up is that I can take larger steps with an LLM than
with TDD, where I do one small thing at a time. Sure, AI will get some things
wrong as a result of the larger steps, but it’s a lot quicker to revert and try
something different when it does.
Summary
In Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java with JUnit, you’ve learned a wealth of
approaches, skills, practices, and design tips. You can apply these skills
immediately to your work and start to reap the multiple benefits of unit testing.
Whether or not you use AI to generate code, unit testing will remain an
important tool in your development toolbox. Without good unit tests, you will
always proceed with considerable risk. Done properly, unit tests will allow
you to go faster and ship with high confidence.

Functional Programming in Java, Second Edition
Imagine writing Java code that reads like the problem
statement, code that’s highly expressive, concise, easy
to read and modify, and has reduced complexity. With
the functional programming capabilities in Java, that’s
not a fantasy. This book will guide you from the famil-
iar imperative style through the practical aspects of
functional programming, using plenty of examples.
Apply the techniques you learn to turn highly complex
imperative code into elegant and easy-to-understand
functional-style code. Updated to the latest version of
Java, this edition has four new chapters on error
handling, refactoring to functional style, transforming
data, and idioms of functional programming.

Java by Comparison
Improve your coding skills by comparing your code to
that of expert programmers so you can write code that’s
clean, concise, and to the point: code that others will
read with pleasure and reuse. Get hands-on advice to
level up your coding style through small and under-
standable examples that compare flawed code to an
improved solution. Discover handy tips and tricks, as
well as common bugs an experienced Java programmer
needs to know. Make your way from a Java novice to
a master craftsman.

Automate Your Home Using Go
Take control of your home and your data with the
power of the Go programming language. Build extraor-
dinary and robust home automation solutions that rival
much more expensive, closed commercial alternatives,
using the same tools found in high-end enterprise
computing environments. Best-selling Pragmatic
Bookshelf authors Ricardo Gerardi and Mike Riley
show how you can use inexpensive Raspberry Pi
hardware and excellent, open source Go-based software
tools like Prometheus and Grafana to create your own
personal data center. Using the step-by-step examples
in the book, build useful home automation projects
that you can use as a blueprint for your own custom
projects.

Small, Sharp Software Tools
The command-line interface is making a comeback.
That’s because developers know that all the best fea-
tures of your operating system are hidden behind a
user interface designed to help average people use the
computer. But you’re not the average user, and the
CLI is the most efficient way to get work done fast.
Turn tedious chores into quick tasks: read and write
files, manage complex directory hierarchies, perform
network diagnostics, download files, work with APIs,
and combine individual programs to create your own
workflows. Put down that mouse, open the CLI, and
take control of your software development environment.

Seven Obscure Languages in Seven Weeks
Explore seven older computer languages and discover
new and fresh ideas that will change the way you think
about programming. These languages were invented
before we settled into our current C-style syntax and
OO biases, so language designers were free to imagine
what was possible. You’ll find their insights thought-
provoking, and their ideas will inspire you to try differ-
ent (and possibly more productive) ways of program-
ming. From a text manipulation language where every
line is a potential state machine event, to a concurrent
language where everything is done using actors, you’re
sure to come away from these seven languages inspired
and excited.

Machine Learning in Elixir
Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, Whisper—these are just a
few examples of incredible applications powered by
developments in machine learning. Despite the ubiquity
of machine learning applications running in produc-
tion, there are only a few viable language choices for
data science and machine learning tasks. Elixir’s Nx
project seeks to change that. With Nx, you can leverage
the power of machine learning in your applications,
using the battle-tested Erlang VM in a pragmatic lan-
guage like Elixir. In this book, you’ll learn how to
leverage Elixir and the Nx ecosystem to solve real-world
problems in computer vision, natural language process-
ing, and more.

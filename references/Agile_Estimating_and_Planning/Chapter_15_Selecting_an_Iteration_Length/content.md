Line 5: Selecting an Iteration Length
Line 6: “Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize
Line 7: till you have tried to make it precise.”
Line 8: —Bertrand Russell
Line 9: The majority of the agile processes, and teams using them, have settled on itera-
Line 10: tion lengths of two to four weeks. Some teams use longer iterations but two to
Line 11: four weeks is an accepted standard for most teams. There’s no one magic itera-
Line 12: tion duration that is right for all teams under all circumstances. The right
Line 13: length for a team on one project may not be the right length for that same team
Line 14: on a different project. 
Line 15: Factors in Selecting an Iteration Length
Line 16: Your selection of iteration length should be guided by the following factors:
Line 17: ◆The length of the release being worked on
Line 18: ◆The amount of uncertainty 
Line 19: ◆The ease of getting feedback
Line 20: ◆How long priorities can remain unchanged
Line 21: ◆Willingness to go without outside feedback
Line 22: ◆The overhead of iterating
Line 23: ◆How soon a feeling of urgency is established

Line 27: Chapter 15
Line 28: Selecting an Iteration Length
Line 29: There is no predetermined relative importance to these factors. The impor-
Line 30: tance of each is entirely dependent upon the context of the project. 
Line 31: The Overall Length of the Release
Line 32: Short projects benefit from short iterations. The length of a project’s iterations
Line 33: determines
Line 34: ◆How often the software can be shown (in potentially shippable form) to us-
Line 35: ers and customers. Yes, of course, the software can be shown in miditeration
Line 36: form to these audiences, but the software usually is of potentially shippable
Line 37: quality only at the end of an iteration.
Line 38: ◆How often progress can be measured. It’s possible to get a sense of a team’s
Line 39: rate of progress during an iteration, but only at the end of an iteration can
Line 40: we truly measure how much work has been truly completed.
Line 41: ◆How often the product owner and team can refine their course, because pri-
Line 42: orities and plans are adjusted between iterations.
Line 43: If a team is working toward a release that is perhaps only three months away,
Line 44: one-month iterations will give them only two opportunities to gather end-of-it-
Line 45: eration feedback, measure progress, and adjust course. In most cases, this will be
Line 46: insufficient. 
Line 47: My general rule of thumb is that any project will benefit from having at least
Line 48: four or five such opportunities. This means that if the overall project duration
Line 49: will be four or more months, it might be worth considering monthly or four-
Line 50: week iterations. If the overall release will, however, be shorter, the project will
Line 51: benefit from proportionally shorter iterations.
Line 52: The Amount of Uncertainty
Line 53: Uncertainty comes in multiple forms. There is often uncertainty about exactly
Line 54: what the customer or users need, what the velocity of the team will be, and about
Line 55: technical aspects of the project. The more uncertainty of any type there is, the
Line 56: shorter the iterations should be. When there is a great deal of uncertainty about
Line 57: the work to be done or the product to be built, short iterations allow more fre-
Line 58: quent opportunites for the team to measure its progress through its velocity and
Line 59: more opportunities to get feedback from stakeholders, customers, and users.

Line 62: How Long Priorities Can Remain Unchanged 
Line 63: |
Line 64: 169
Line 65: The Ease of Getting Feedback
Line 66: Iteration length should be chosen to maximize the amount, frequency, and time-
Line 67: liness of feedback to the whole team. Depending on the environment, this may
Line 68: mean longer or shorter iterations. In some organizations, it is extremely easy to
Line 69: get informal feedback from internal stakeholders or users throughout an itera-
Line 70: tion but extemely difficult to get these same individuals to participate in a sched-
Line 71: uled end-of-iteration review meeting. Other organizations have the opposite
Line 72: problem; it is difficult to get feedback on a day-to-day basis, but stakeholders, us-
Line 73: ers, and others will attend a scheduled, formal review meeting (especially if food
Line 74: is provided).
Line 75: Choose your iteration length to maximize the value of the feedback that can
Line 76: be received from those inside and outside the organization.
Line 77: How Long Priorities Can Remain Unchanged
Line 78: Once a development team commits to completing a specific set of features in an
Line 79: iteration, it is important that they not be redirected from that goal. It is, there-
Line 80: fore, important that the product owner not change priorities during the itera-
Line 81: tion and that she help protect the team from others who may attempt to change
Line 82: priorities. Because of this, the length of time that priorities can go unchanged is
Line 83: a factor in selecting the iteration length.
Line 84: A key consideration is how long it takes a good new idea to be turned into
Line 85: working software. Consider the case of a team using four-week iterations. If we
Line 86: assume that new ideas are equally likely to occur any time during an iteration,
Line 87: on average, a new idea can be said to occur in the middle of the iteration. That
Line 88: new idea will be prioritized into the next iteration, which starts in two weeks. It
Line 89: will take another four weeks (a full iteration) before the new idea shows up as po-
Line 90: tentially shippable, working software. This is shown in Figure 15.1. The key
Line 91: point to remember from this example is that the time from new idea to working
Line 92: software will be an average of 1½ times the length of the team’s iterations.
Line 93: As described in Chapter 14, “Iteration Planning,” a team with maintenance
Line 94: or support duties concurrent with their new development work will hold some
Line 95: amount of time in reserve for those support and maintenance activities.
Line 96: Figure 15.1 is really illustrating the situation in which someone approaches the
Line 97: team with an idea that does not fit as part of their maintenance or support
Line 98: reserve.

Line 102: Chapter 15
Line 103: Selecting an Iteration Length
Line 104: Figure 15.1 It takes an average of 1½ iterations to go from idea to software.
Line 105: Willingness to Go without Outside Feedback
Line 106: Even with a well-intentioned and highly communicative team, it is possible that
Line 107: the results of an iteration could be found worthless when shown to the broader
Line 108: organization or external users at the conclusion of the iteration. This may hap-
Line 109: pen if the developers misunderstand the product owner (and don’t communicate
Line 110: often enough during the iteration). It could also happen if the product owner
Line 111: misunderstands the needs of the market or users. The loss is almost never com-
Line 112: plete as long as we learn something from it. However, the less often a team re-
Line 113: ceives outside feedback, the more likely we are to go astray and the greater the
Line 114: loss will be when that happens.
Line 115: The Overhead of Iterating
Line 116: There are costs associated with each iteration. For example, each iteration must
Line 117: be fully regression tested. If this is costly (usually in terms of time), the team
Line 118: may prefer longer, four-week iterations. Naturally, one of the goals of a success-
Line 119: ful agile team is to reduce (or nearly eliminate) the overhead associated with
Line 120: each iteration. But especially during a team’s early iterations, this cost can be
Line 121: significant and will influence the decision about the best iteration length.
Line 122: How Soon a Feeling of Urgency Is Established
Line 123: Colleague Niels Malotaux (2004) points out that “As long as the end date of a
Line 124: project is far in the future, we don’t feel any pressure and work leisurely. When
Line 125: the pressure of the finish date becomes tangible, we start working harder.” Even
Line 126: with four-week iterations the end date is never very far in the future. But it is
Line 127: Week 1
Line 128: Week 2
Line 129: Week 3
Line 130: Week 4
Line 131: Week 5
Line 132: Week 6

Line 136: new idea is
Line 137: identified here...
Line 138: ...gets planned into
Line 139: an iteration here...
Line 140: ...and is delivered here.

Line 146: |
Line 147: 171
Line 148: sufficiently far away that many teams will feel tangibly less stress during their
Line 149: first week than during the fourth and final week of an iteration. 
Line 150: The solution to this, of course, is to select an iteration length that evens out
Line 151: the pressure the team feels. The point is not to put the team under more
Line 152: pressure (“You will deliver today!”). Rather, it is to take the total amount of stress
Line 153: they’d normally feel and distribute it more evenly across a suitably long
Line 154: iteration.
Line 155: Making a Decision
Line 156: One of the main goals in selecting an iteration length is finding one that encour-
Line 157: ages everyone to work at a consistent pace throughout the iteration. If the dura-
Line 158: tion is too long, there is a natural tendency to relax a bit at the start of the
Line 159: iteration, which leads to panic and longer hours at the end of the iteration.
Line 160: Strive to find an interation duration that smooths out these variations.
Line 161: Having experimented with a variety of iteration lengths, my general prefer-
Line 162: ence is two weeks. One-week iterations (or anything shorter) can be very hectic
Line 163: and stressful. The next deadline is never more than four days away. Extremely
Line 164: short iterations leave no time for recovery if a team member is out sick or if
Line 165: Stick with It to Achieve a Steady Rhythm
Line 166: Whatever duration you choose, you are better off choosing a duration
Line 167: and sticking with it rather than changing it frequently. Teams fall into a
Line 168: natural rhythm when using an unchanging iteration duration. When I
Line 169: started doing agile development using an early variation of Scrum
Line 170: (Takeuchi and Nonaka 1986; DeGrace and Stahl 1990), my teams used to
Line 171: select the duration of each iteration based on the amount of work we
Line 172: were bringing into that iteration. A two-week iteration could be fol-
Line 173: lowed by a six-week iteration, which could be followed by a four-week
Line 174: iteration, and so on. Through experimentation on many projects, I have
Line 175: since learned that teams are far better off sizing the work to the length
Line 176: of the iteration (rather than sizing the iteration to the work).
Line 177: A regular iteration rhythm acts like a heartbeat for the project. Col-
Line 178: league Simon Baker, an agile coach with think-box ltd., describes it by
Line 179: saying that “Like a heart beats with a regularity that keeps the body go-
Line 180: ing, a fixed iteration duration provides a constant which helps establish a
Line 181: development (and delivery) rhythm. Rhythm in my experience is a signif-
Line 182: icant factor that helps achieve a sustained pace” (2004).
Line 183: 
Line 184: --- 페이지 203 ---
Line 185: 172 |
Line 186: Chapter 15
Line 187: Selecting an Iteration Length
Line 188: anything goes wrong. Unless a project already has fully automated tests for all
Line 189: parts of the system, I do not often recommend starting with one-week iterations.
Line 190: A four-week iteration, on the other hand, begins to feel like an eternity after
Line 191: having worked in one- and two-week iterations. With four-week iterations, I find
Line 192: that the team often has time to investigate and pursue more creative solutions
Line 193: than they may have time for with shorter iterations. An experienced agile team
Line 194: working on a highly exploratory phase of a project may benefit from a four-week
Line 195: iteration. However, four-week iterations have a feeling of very distinct begin-
Line 196: nings, middles, and ends. I don’t like how different the relaxed beginning feels
Line 197: from the more frantic end.
Line 198: I find two-week iterations to be ideal. The overhead for planning and testing
Line 199: is much more manageable when amortized across two weeks. The first week of a
Line 200: two-week iteration may feel different from the second week, but the difference is
Line 201: not as dramatic as on a four-week iteration. Additionally, most organizations can
Line 202: (with sufficient training) learn not to adjust priorities for two weeks, whereas do-
Line 203: ing so for four weeks can be very difficult.
Line 204: 6 x 2 + 1
Line 205: Working on endless two-week iterations can be a strain on a team be-
Line 206: cause of the constant pressure to deliver and because a deadline is never
Line 207: further away than next week. My favorite technique to help reduce this
Line 208: strain is follow a macro-cycle of six two-week iterations followed by a
Line 209: one-week iteration. I refer to this cycle as “6 x 2 + 1.” During the two-
Line 210: week iterations, the team works on items prioritized by the product
Line 211: owner. During the one-week iteration, however, the team chooses its
Line 212: own work. That doesn’t mean it’s play time or a week at the beach.
Line 213: Rather, the individuals on the team use this time to focus on what they
Line 214: view as priority work for the project. Programmers may perform refac-
Line 215: torings they felt were too risky in the middle of other iterations or exper-
Line 216: iment with relevant new technologies. A tester may catch up on
Line 217: automating legacy manual tests. An analyst may work on an upcoming
Line 218: large feature that she feels hasn’t received enough attention.
Line 219: The chance to have one week of work they collectively prioritize
Line 220: themselves can be very reinvigorating for a team. It is important to stress
Line 221: that this one-week iteration is not a dumping ground for the sloppy
Line 222: work of previous iterations. Rather, it is a time when teams may work off
Line 223: some of the technical debt incurred either during early iterations while
Line 224: learning to be agile or from the project’s pre-agile days.

Line 227: The Napa Project 
Line 228: |
Line 229: 173
Line 230: Two Case Studies
Line 231: To see how to apply these factors, let’s consider two teams: the Napa team and
Line 232: the Goodman team. Each is a real team with only a few minor details changed.
Line 233: The Napa Project
Line 234: The seven-person Napa team was working on a client-server desktop application.
Line 235: The application would be used by 600 employees of the company. It would not be
Line 236: sold or used outside the company. Users were located in three cities, one of
Line 237: which was also home to the entire development team. The idea for the product
Line 238: began as a technology update of an existing system that had become expensive to
Line 239: maintain. However, due to changes in the company’s core business, a great deal
Line 240: of new functionality was planned in the project as well. The project had been es-
Line 241: timated to take thirteen months, but the company’s rapid growth was creating
Line 242: pressure for an earlier release, even if it included only partial functionality.
Line 243: For the Napa project, the team chose four-week iterations. We knew the
Line 244: project would be at least six months, so even four-week iterations gave us plenty
Line 245: of opportunities to bring the software to a potentially releasable state so that we
Line 246: could put it in the hands of real users. The project had a fair but not excessive
Line 247: amount of requirements and technology uncertainty. The developers were all ex-
Line 248: perienced in the technologies being used (C++ and Oracle). And even though the
Line 249: new application would have features taking it well beyond what the current ap-
Line 250: plication did, we had the current application as a basic model of what was
Line 251: needed.
Line 252: The project team was collocated with many of the intended users of the sys-
Line 253: tem. Most of the users were eager to participate in discussions about what would
Line 254: become their new system. However, the company was growing so quickly that
Line 255: access to these users was partially restricted. We had to be careful not to use too
Line 256: much of their time. Four-week iterations worked well in this situation. Showing
Line 257: them new versions every two weeks would have been too much in this environ-
Line 258: ment. By making a new version available every four weeks, we were able to get
Line 259: more of the users to experiment with the software in a sandbox we had set up for
Line 260: that purpose.
Line 261: As this was an entirely new application, there was very little overhead of iter-
Line 262: ating so this wasn’t a factor in the decision. This project was critical to the con-
Line 263: tinued success of the company and had extremely high visibility from the CEO
Line 264: down. For the most part, we were able to establish and maintain priorities for
Line 265: four weeks. Even with four weeks, a sense of urgency was maintained because

Line 268: 174 |
Line 269: Chapter 15
Line 270: Selecting an Iteration Length
Line 271: the team remained aware of the need to get an initial release into users’ hands as
Line 272: quickly as possible. 
Line 273: The Goodman Project
Line 274: The Goodman team was working on the first version of an enterprise, commer-
Line 275: cial application. Over the course of the first three years, the company expected to
Line 276: sell no more than 5,000 licenses for the software. However, the product would be
Line 277: expensive, with an average price of $50,000 per user. Eighteen developers were
Line 278: split among two coordinated teams. The Goodman project was expected to take a
Line 279: year, but a preliminary release was planned to go to a handful of customers after
Line 280: six months.
Line 281: For the Goodman project, the team chose two-week iterations. Because we
Line 282: were targeting an initial release six months out, the team could have used four-
Line 283: week iterations. However, there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty on this
Line 284: project. The company thought it knew who the product’s users would be, but oc-
Line 285: casional debates about this raged within the company. It wasn’t clear whether
Line 286: the product should be the high-end, high-price system that was initially con-
Line 287: ceived or whether we should aim for a larger audience at a lower price. This de-
Line 288: cision was made, remade, and then remade again, but never with sufficient force
Line 289: that the team could feel confident in the answer. There was also a large compo-
Line 290: nent of emergent requirements of the “I’ll know it when I see it” variety.
Line 291: Feedback was difficult to come by on this troubled project. Because it was a
Line 292: commercial product, we had no internal users. Many of the company’s largest
Line 293: customers and prospects were overseas, which complicated matters. There were
Line 294: a number of people within the company who would have been likely users had
Line 295: they worked at our target customer companies, so we used them as proxies for
Line 296: our real users. Because of all the uncertainty and change on this project, we
Line 297: wanted to get feedback as often as possible, which pointed toward shorter itera-
Line 298: tions.
Line 299: Priorities could not remain constant for more than a few days in this envi-
Line 300: ronment, which also pointed us toward the short, two-week iterations we chose.
Line 301: The test automation team on this project had been in place from the beginning
Line 302: of the project and did a very good job. This helped keep the overhead of iterating
Line 303: low and allowed us to be successful with short iterations. Finally, as the company
Line 304: was a recent start-up and newly public company, it was important that we main-
Line 305: tain a sense of urgency. The company had gone public on the promise of some
Line 306: great software coming soon. Short, two-week iterations helped us keep a strong
Line 307: focus on getting that software developed as quickly as possible.

Line 310: Summary 
Line 311: |
Line 312: 175
Line 313: Summary
Line 314: Most agile teams work in iterations of two to four weeks. There is no universally
Line 315: correct iteration length that is right for all teams. Rather, each team should con-
Line 316: sider their unique situation and choose the right iteration length for them. Fac-
Line 317: tors in this decision include
Line 318: ◆The length of the release being worked on
Line 319: ◆The amount of uncertainty 
Line 320: Avoid the End of the Quarter
Line 321: Although it may be tempting to align iterations with the end of the
Line 322: month, I avoid doing so at all costs. If you tie iterations to the ends of
Line 323: months, one out of every three iterations will coincide with the end of a
Line 324: fiscal quarter. Although this is not quite as much of a problem with pri-
Line 325: vate companies, there is tremendous pressure in public companies to hit
Line 326: quarterly revenue goals.
Line 327: I was on one project that had scheduled a significant new release for
Line 328: Friday, March 31, 2000. This release had been a key target for much of
Line 329: the company for nine months (which is the upper limit for how long a
Line 330: single release should be). With two weeks left before the release, our
Line 331: product owner left for a spring-break vacation with his school-age kids.
Line 332: While at Disney World, he valiantly tried to participate in some calls and
Line 333: answer some of our more important questions. Still, his absence came at
Line 334: a critical time, and some important work was not completed in what was
Line 335: to be the final iteration before the big release.
Line 336: When the product owner returned, we were able to resolve all re-
Line 337: maining open issues within a shorter-than-normal one-week iteration.
Line 338: This pushed our release date out from March 31 to April 7. Although a
Line 339: difference of one week may not seem highly critical to a nine-month
Line 340: project, the fact that the delay pushed delivery from one quarter to the
Line 341: next was hugely significant to this publicly traded company. When the
Line 342: planned initial shipment of hundreds of copies didn’t happen on March
Line 343: 31, the revenue from those presales and upgrades could not be recog-
Line 344: nized until the second quarter. We might as well have delivered on June
Line 345: 30 as April 7.
Line 346: I haven’t planned a month-end release since then. There are too many
Line 347: unknowns, unknowables, and uncertainties in software development for
Line 348: me to want to risk recognizing revenue by targeting an end-of-the-
Line 349: quarter release.

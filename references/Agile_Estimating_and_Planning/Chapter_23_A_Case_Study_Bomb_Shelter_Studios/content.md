Line 6: Studios
Line 7: The flight was a long one, but the conference had been a success. Flights back
Line 8: from the East Coast were always the hardest, but on this flight Frank had up-
Line 9: graded to first class, exchanging some of his frequent-flyer miles for a bit more
Line 10: room and comfort. Reflecting on the week’s events, Frank settled into his seat.
Line 11: As a product manager for Bomb Shelter Studios, Frank knew that the com-
Line 12: pany’s latest game, Deep Black & White, would do well. It played a game called
Line 13: Go that was extremely popular in Japan, China, and Korea but had only a moder-
Line 14: ate following in Europe, North America, and the rest of the world. The program-
Line 15: mers on his team had come up with artificial intelligence breakthroughs that
Line 16: allowed Deep Black & White to play at a level known as 5-dan. This was still far
Line 17: from the 9-dan level of the best professional players, but it was far ahead of
Line 18: where any of Bomb Shelter’s competitors were.
Line 19: Frank was ecstatic that Deep Black & White would be released and marketed
Line 20: in Asia through the distribution deal he’d negotiated with a publisher at the con-
Line 21: ference. The revenue from sales in those markets would really help Bomb
Line 22: Shelter. Frank knew that the additional six months it took to complete Deep
Line 23: Black & White had almost been the end of the small, privately held game devel-
Line 24: opment company he had co-founded.
Line 25: From its inauspicious beginnings three years ago, Bomb Shelter Studios
Line 26: had become recognized as a high-end developer of thinking and strategy games.
Line 27: In addition to the newly finished Deep Black & White, Bomb Shelter had devel-
Line 28: oped games that played chess, backgammon, reversi, bridge, checkers, mancala,
Line 29: and similar games. Once a game was developed, distribution rights were sold to

Line 31: --- 페이지 293 ---
Line 32: 262 |
Line 33: Chapter 23
Line 34: A Case Study: Bomb Shelter Studios
Line 35: a publisher that would take care of all production and distribuiton, allowing
Line 36: Bomb Shelter to focus entirely on developing new games.
Line 37: While Frank had been at the conference, his analyst and small team back in
Line 38: Santa Barbara had been thinking about the new game, Havannah, that they were
Line 39: nearly ready to start. Because of the problems with Deep Black & White—not
Line 40: just the six-month delay, but also finding too many bugs and uncovering some
Line 41: usability issues late—Frank knew that they had to find a different way of plan-
Line 42: ning and developing projects. Sasha, the company’s lead architect, researched
Line 43: some ideas the team had. She suggested using what they were calling an “agile
Line 44: process” for the next project. Frank wasn’t exactly sure what that meant, but he
Line 45: was sure they needed to do something different. Being six months late on the
Line 46: next game wasn’t going to work. Everyone on the team was excited to give an ag-
Line 47: ile process a try, and they all knew what was at stake.
Line 48: Day 1—Monday Morning
Line 49: “Good morning, everyone,” Frank said as he entered the conference room. It was
Line 50: still a minute before nine, and almost the entire team was already waiting for
Line 51: him. That was a good sign. Even though the team was tired from the final push
Line 52: on Deep Black & White, it looked like they were ready to get right back in it for
Line 53: Havannah.
Line 54: “Good morning, Frank. I saw your email about Deep Black & White. That’s
Line 55: great news on the distribution deal,” said Allan, the C++ programmer who had
Line 56: coded the artificial intelligence engine that let Deep Black & White play such a
Line 57: strong game.
Line 58: “Have a donut, Frank,” Sasha said as she pushed the nearly empty box across
Line 59: the table.”
Line 60: “Thanks,” Frank said, taking a maple bar from the box. 
Line 61: “Frank, this is Carlos,” Sasha said. “Carlos is an experienced agile coach.
Line 62: We’ve brought him in to help us as we learn to work in this new, agile way.”
Line 63: Frank and Carlos shook hands and exchanged greetings.
Line 64: “It looks like everyone is here except Rose,” Frank said. “Let’s go ahead and
Line 65: get started. We can fill her in later. We probably won’t talk about the artwork
Line 66: much in this meeting anyway.”
Line 67: “We can’t start, Frank,” Carlos said. “This is important. We need the whole
Line 68: team here. A big part of the benefit we’re after from trying an agile process re-
Line 69: quires everyone to participate. Rose may not have much to say about the

Line 74: 263
Line 75: artificial intelligence in the move engine. But even so, we need her perspective if
Line 76: we want to plan the best possible game we can.”
Line 77: “She always gets here about five minutes after nine on Monday. She drops
Line 78: Brooke at school on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. She’ll be here,” Prasad said,
Line 79: finishing almost exactly as Rose opened the door to the conference room.
Line 80: “Sorry. Traffic,” Rose said, quickly sliding into a chair. 
Line 81: “So, Delaney, you’ve been doing the product research on Havannah,” Frank
Line 82: said to the analyst. “It’s been a while since I’ve thought about that game. I’m
Line 83: sorry to ask, but can you tell me how to play it again?”
Line 84: “Sure, Frank. First, the board looks like this,” Delaney said as she pulled a
Line 85: wooden board from her bag and placed it on the table. The board looked like
Line 86: Figure 23.1. “There are two players who take turns placing a piece on the board.
Line 87: Each player has different colored pieces. Once a piece is played on the board, it
Line 88: can’t move.”
Line 89: Figure 23.1 An empty Havannah board.
Line 90: “Just like in Deep Black & White,” Frank said.
Line 91: “Right, but unlike in Go, pieces cannot be captured. The goal in Havannah is
Line 92: to be the first player to make a ring, a bridge, or a fork. Whoever does that wins
Line 93: the game.”
Line 94: “And what are rings, bridges, and forks?” Frank asked as Delaney grabbed a
Line 95: handful of pieces and began to arrange them on the board.
Line 96: “A ring is the simplest. It looks like this,” Delaney said as she drew
Line 97: Figure 23.2. “A ring is a set of connecting pieces that encloses one or more
Line 98: points.”

Line 104: Figure 23.2 A ring.
Line 105: “OK, that sounds easy enough. What makes this game hard?” said Allan, who
Line 106: was already thinking ahead to the work of writing the artificial intelligence en-
Line 107: gine that would select moves.
Line 108: “Remember, a ring is just one of the ways to win. You can also win with a
Line 109: fork or a bridge,” Delaney continued as she arranged the pieces as shown in
Line 110: Figure 23.3. “A bridge connects any two corners. The bridge could run in a
Line 111: straight line along an edge from one corner to an adjacent corner. More likely,
Line 112: though, a bridge will look more like this.” She pointed to the bridge on the right
Line 113: of the board in Figure 23.3.

Line 120: “Does a player have to say which shape he’ll be trying to make before the
Line 121: game starts?” Allan asked.
Line 122: “No, that’s part of the fun and part of the challenge. You can start out trying
Line 123: to make a bridge, realize that’s not going to work, and maybe try a fork.”
Line 124: “So what’s a fork?”
Line 125: “It’s like this, Frank,” Delaney said as she added some more pieces to the
Line 126: board, as shown in Figure 23.4. “A fork connects three edges, not corners. Cor-
Line 127: ners aren’t edges, so they can’t be used in a fork—just in a bridge.”
Line 128: Figure 23.4 The winning shapes in a game of Havannah: a fork, a ring, and a bridge.
Line 129: “Programming the move engine is going to be a challenge. With so many
Line 130: possible ways to win and so many spaces on the board, the options are tremen-
Line 131: dous.”
Line 132: “You’re right, Allan,” Delaney said. “Many people think this game is harder
Line 133: than chess because there are more options and because we can’t use a huge end-
Line 134: game book, like we can in chess. In chess, once we get down to a few pieces left,
Line 135: it’s possible to use a book of the best moves to play. At that point we don’t need
Line 136: to rely on just the move engine to select a move. With Havannah, there are too
Line 137: many pieces and too many positions.”
Line 138: “You didn’t want an easy game to program, did you, Allan?” Sasha teased the
Line 139: other programmer.
Line 140: Allan looked like maybe he did want an easy game to program this time.
Line 141: “Don’t worry. The good news is that because so few people play Havannah
Line 142: right now, we don’t need as strong an engine as we did with Deep Black &
Line 143: White,” Delaney said, noting the slight look of relief on Allan’s face. “We’ll want
Line 144: 
Line 145: --- 페이지 297 ---
Line 146: 266 |
Line 147: Chapter 23
Line 148: A Case Study: Bomb Shelter Studios
Line 149: to get there eventually, but we won’t need it in version 1.0. A decent engine that
Line 150: beats most humans most of the time will be fine.”
Line 151: “OK, Delaney. Are there any other rules we need to be aware of?” Frank
Line 152: asked.
Line 153: “No, that’s it. The rules are simple, but this game really makes you think.
Line 154: That’s why we think it will do well with customers who’ve bought our other
Line 155: games.”
Line 156: “So, do you have a requirements document written?” 
Line 157: “Not yet, Frank. From what Carlos has taught us about agile software devel-
Line 158: opment, we want the whole team together to figure the requirements out collab-
Line 159: oratively.”
Line 160: “Right,” Carlos added. “We’re going to start today’s meeting by writing user
Line 161: stories. They’re brief statements of functionality but told from the user’s per-
Line 162: spective. For example, As a user, I want to save a game I’m in the middle of. Stuff
Line 163: like that.”
Line 164: “That sounds easy enough. What do we do with those once we’re done with
Line 165: them?”
Line 166: “We’ll estimate each one, prioritize them, and then figure out the best
Line 167: tradeoff between features and schedule,” Carlos said.
Line 168: “So how do we get started writing the user stories?” Frank asked.
Line 169: “We’re going to use these note cards,” Carlos said as he tossed a package of
Line 170: cards to each person in the room. “I like to write user stories in this template.”
Line 171: Carlos picked up a marker and wrote “As a <user type>, I want to <goal> so that
Line 172: <reason>” on the whiteboard. “Delaney, you’ve done the most thinking about
Line 173: Havannah; can you get us started?”
Line 174: “Sure,” the analyst said. “Let’s start with, As a player, I can undo a move so
Line 175: that I can take back a big mistake.”
Line 176: “Is that our first story?” asked Prasad, the tester.
Line 177: “Yes, so I’ll write it on a note card so we don’t forget it,” Delaney said as she
Line 178: wrote Story Card 23.1.
Line 179: “Do we estimate that story now?” Allan asked.
Line 180: As a player, I can undo a move so that I can take back a big mistake.

Line 186: 267
Line 187: “Not yet, Allan. It will be easier if we write a bunch of stories first and then
Line 188: estimate them at the same time,” Carlos said.
Line 189: “My turn. If we’ve got an undo story, we need a redo story. As a player, I want
Line 190: to redo a move that I’ve undone so that I can replay a sequence,” Frank said.
Line 191: “Good story, Frank. Write it on a card,” Carlos told the product manager.
Line 192: “Wouldn’t it be better if we typed these into a spreadsheet?” Frank asked.
Line 193: “Perhaps later. But in a meeting like this, it helps to have the physical cards.
Line 194: You’ll see,” Carlos said. “We can each write any story whenever we think of it. We
Line 195: don’t need to wait for whoever is typing.”
Line 196: “And when we get to planning, the cards are even more useful,” Sasha added.
Line 197: “We can stack the cards by priority or into what we’ll do in each iteration.”
Line 198: Frank began to see some other advantages to using the note cards. He could
Line 199: write additional notes or draw on the cards. He couldn’t do that in a spreadsheet.
Line 200: He still hadn’t learned much about the team’s new “agile process,” but he liked
Line 201: what he’d seen so far. With growing enthusiasm, he wrote Story Card 23.2.
Line 202: “A good way to get all the stories is to…” Carlos began.
Line 203: “Do you really mean all, Carlos?” Sasha asked the team’s new coach.
Line 204: “Yes. Kind of. I’d like to use this meeting to write as many story cards as we
Line 205: can. Undo and redo are pretty small. We don’t need our stories to be that small.
Line 206: In fact, we should probably combine undo and redo.”
Line 207: “OK. I’ll do that,” Frank said as he wrote Story Card 23.3. “How do we indi-
Line 208: cate that this card is related to the other two cards? Do we number them?”
Line 209: “No, just rip up the first two,” Carlos said. “We won’t need them.”
Line 210: Frank ripped the first two cards in half.
Line 211: As a player, I want to redo a move that I’ve undone so that I can replay
Line 212: a sequence.

Line 221: “Carlos, Frank didn’t include a reason on the reason card. There’s no ‘so
Line 222: that.’ Is that a problem?” Allan asked.
Line 223: “Hey, it’s only my second story!” Frank mockingly defended himself.
Line 224: “Actually,” Carlos clarified, “we don’t always need a ‘so that’ clause. If it helps
Line 225: make the story more clear, use one. But it’s not worth worrying about, especially
Line 226: on a story like this one, where it’s obvious why a user would want to do that.”
Line 227: “Carlos, you said we want to write all the stories today, even if some are writ-
Line 228: ten at a high level. I assume we can add more later. Right?” asked Rose.
Line 229: “Absolutely. Ideally we do think of some additional stories later. Otherwise, it
Line 230: means we’re not thinking creatively enough about the game. I’d hate to think
Line 231: that we don’t come up with some ideas later that are better than the ones we
Line 232: start with today. The purpose of writing ‘all’ the stories today is so that we’re all
Line 233: aware—again, just at a high level—of what features are likely. This especially
Line 234: helps Sasha and Allan as they think about the architecture of the game and even
Line 235: how they’ll design the move engine.”
Line 236: “OK. That sounds great, Carlos. Let’s keep going. Do we all just start writing
Line 237: cards?”
Line 238: “We could,” Carlos said. “But it works best if we apply some structure to it.
Line 239: Let’s talk through what a user may want to do at various times in the game—be-
Line 240: fore a game starts, during the game, and even after the game.”
Line 241: Various nods and comments of agreement came from the rest of the team as
Line 242: Carlos continued: “Right when Havannah loads, what might someone want to
Line 243: do?”
Line 244: “Start a game.”
Line 245: “Restore a saved game.”
Line 246: “Select the computer’s playing strength.”
Line 247: “OK, let’s get those written,” Carlos said. A few minutes later, the team had
Line 248: produced the stories shown in Table 23.1.
Line 249: “Carlos,” Frank asked, “if these stories are things a player may want to do be-
Line 250: fore the game starts, why do we include As a player, I want the system to play
Line 251: background music? Isn’t that something the player wants while playing the
Line 252: game, rather than before?”
Line 253: “We’re just brainstorming the user stories,” Carlos answered. “We won’t
Line 254: keep track of which stories happen before the game starts and which happen
Line 255: during it. I’m just using that approach to help us think through what we need in
Line 256: the game.”
Line 257: “OK. What do we do next?”
Line 258: “Now we think about what a user might want want to do during a game.”

Line 263: 269
Line 264: The team answered Carlos’ question by writing the stories shown in
Line 265: Table 23.2.
Line 266: “OK, I suppose we should move on to things that a user may want to do after
Line 267: a game is finished,” Frank said.
Line 268: “There isn’t much a player would want to do after a game is over. We didn’t
Line 269: think of saving a game earlier, so we can add that,” Prasad said.
Line 270: “A player may also want to go back and annotate moves. Deep Black & White
Line 271: supports that,” Rose said. “I can put a note on a move like ‘I also thought of play-
Line 272: ing on hexagon A3.’”
Line 273: “OK, let’s get these written as stories,” Carlos said, which resulted in
Line 274: Table 23.3.
Line 275: “What next, Carlos?” Allan asked.
Line 276: “While you put the finishing touches on Deep Black & White over the next
Line 277: two weeks, Delaney is going to do some more product research.”
Line 278: “Yes,” Delaney added. “I want to validate with prospective users the features
Line 279: they think are the most important.”

Line 304: “What we’re going to do,” Carlos resumed the meeting, “is estimate each story as

Line 306: “What’s a story point?” asked Frank.
Line 307: “A story point is a unitless estimate of the size and complexity of a story,” an-
Line 308: swered Carlos. “Suppose we decide that saving a game is three points. If we think
Line 309: that restoring a saved game will be the same effort, we’ll call it three points. If we
Line 310: think restoring a game will be a little less, we’ll call it a two.”

Line 334: 271
Line 335: “Only relatively. A two is twice a one. An eight is four times a two. Like that.
Line 336: That’s all that matters,” Carlos clarified. “We’re going to estimate by playing
Line 337: planning poker.” Carlos handed each person a set of cards with the values 1, 2, 3,
Line 338: 5, and 8 written on them. “The way this works is Delaney will read us one of the
Line 339: story cards. We can talk about it and ask questions. Then we’ll each pick one of
Line 340: the cards I just passed out. Those numbers are our estimates. When we’ve each
Line 341: picked a card, we’ll turn them over at the same time. If we all agree, that’s the
Line 342: estimate. If not, we’ll discuss our estimates and the story for a couple of minutes,
Line 343: and then we’ll do it again. We’ll keep doing it until we agree on an estimate for
Line 344: the story.”
Line 345: Carlos answered a few questions about the technique and then asked
Line 346: Delaney to read the first story: “As a player, I can start a new game.”
Line 347: “The first story or two are always hard to estimate,” Sasha added. “Because
Line 348: we’re estimating stories relative to each other, it’s hard when there’s nothing to
Line 349: compare with. We mostly just need to decide whether this initial story is one of
Line 350: the smaller ones or one of the larger ones we’ve got. If, after we’ve estimated four
Line 351: or five stories, we decide we need to change the estimate on this first one, we
Line 352: can.”
Line 353: “What do we mean by this story?” Allan asked. “It’s not clear what starting a
Line 354: new game means.”
Line 355: “We wrote this story when we were thinking about what a user might want
Line 356: to do after first starting our software,” said Delaney. “We said she’ll probably
Line 357: want to start a new game or restore an old game. That’s all we meant.”
Line 358: “Does this story include drawing a blank game board and setting things up
Line 359: so that the computer is ready to play a game?” Allan asked.
Line 360: “I think it does. I don’t think the board needs to be pretty for this story.
Line 361: We’ve got another story about making the screen aesthetically pleasing. But this
Line 362: story does require that we draw the Havannah board on the screen.”

Line 378: “It’s a one,” said Allan, showing everyone his card.
Line 379: “Not yet, Allan,” Carlos said. “Everyone needs a chance to think about it

Line 381: paused. “It looks like everyone has picked a card. Turn them over.”

Line 385: “Not even close,” argued Allan. “All this story needs is a user interface where
Line 386: a player can choose a Start New Game button and then have it draw a blank Ha-
Line 387: vannah board. The board doesn’t have to be pretty, and it doesn’t need to let the
Line 388: user place any pieces. We have separate stories for those. This story is easy.”
Line 389: “OK, I hadn’t thought of it that way,” said Prasad.
Line 390: After allowing the discussion to continue a little longer, Carlos again asked
Line 391: everyone to select a card representing his or her estimate. Most estimates were
Line 392: now ones, with a two shown by Prasad. Carlos encouraged another short conver-
Line 393: sation and then asked Prasad if he could support an estimate of one. He said he
Line 394: could, and the first story was estimated at one story point.
Line 395: “On to our next story,” said Delaney, who read, “As a player, I can restore a
Line 396: saved game.” After two minutes of discussion about how this story would work,
Line 397: Carlos asked each team member to select a card. There was no consensus on the
Line 398: first round of cards. Sasha argued that this story was twice as big as the first
Line 399: story because it involved setting up a blank Havannah board, reading the saved
Line 400: game from a file, and placing the pieces that had already been played on the
Line 401: board. Convinced by Sasha’s arguments, the team agreed on an estimate of two
Line 402: for the story.
Line 403: “OK, next is As a player, I can select the computer’s playing strength. Let’s
Line 404: estimate that,” said Sasha.
Line 405: “That’s the whole move-selection engine,” said Allan. “That’s going to be
Line 406: hard. Can we skip this one for now and come back to it after we’ve estimated
Line 407: some of the other big stories?”
Line 408: “That’s OK with me,” Sasha said.
Line 409: “Wait, though,” Rose said. “I thought this story was about letting the user
Line 410: pick a playing strength, not about the computer playing at that strength. This is
Line 411: easy; it’s just a field or two on the screen.”
Line 412: “That’s how I meant the story when I wrote it,” Frank said.

Line 418: “That’s fine but then we need a story like, As a player, I can play against the
Line 419: computer at different playing strengths,” Rose said.
Line 420: “Can we split that up, though?” Allan asked. “I think that’s going to be hard.
Line 421: How about As a player, I can play against a weak computer opponent? And then
Line 422: As a player, I can play against a strong computer opponent and a medium com-
Line 423: puter opponent?”
Line 424: “Sure. Let’s do that,” Sasha said. “Let’s start with the player selecting the
Line 425: computer’s playing strength. Everyone pick one of your planning poker cards.
Line 426: OK? Ready; turn them over.” Everyone turned over a one. “That seems reason-
Line 427: able to me. We’re saying this is about the same size as As a player, I can start a
Line 428: new game.”
Line 429: There were nods of agreement that the two stories were indeed about the
Line 430: same size.
Line 431: “Let’s move on to the As a player, I can play against a weak computer oppo-
Line 432: nent story,” Allan suggested, eager to talk about the move-engine stories that
Line 433: he’d probably be the one to program. “How strong does our weak engine need to
Line 434: be?”
Line 435: “It can’t play randomly,” Delaney said. “But it doesn’t have to be very strong.
Line 436: This game is deceptively hard, and it takes most people a while to figure out
Line 437: what’s a good move. But even our weak level needs to know whether it’s best to
Line 438: try to make a ring, a bridge, or a fork, based on what the human player is doing.”
Line 439: “OK, let’s estimate it,” Allan said. 
Line 440: “Wait,” Prasad said. “How are we going to test this? It seems like it’s going to
Line 441: be really hard to test.”
Line 442: “Good question,” Carlos said. “Any ideas?” He looked around the room.
Line 443: “One way would be to identify a bunch of positions, see what the engine sug-
Line 444: gests, and ask a good human player if those are decent moves,” Rose said. 
Line 445: “That’s good. Can we automate that, though?” Delaney asked. “We need to
Line 446: automate the tests so that if the engine starts making weird moves, like Deep
Line 447: Black & White did in April, we know about it immediately.”
Line 448: “Absolutely,” Prasad answered. “We can have a file that describes a board po-
Line 449: sition and then says how the computer should respond.”
Line 450: “There may not be just one acceptable move,” Allan said. “That file should al-
Line 451: low us to specify multiple good responses.” 
Line 452: “Great answers. We don’t need to design that file now, though, as long as we
Line 453: know there are some options. Let’s estimate the story,” Carlos said.

Line 459: The room grew quiet as each person thought about all that would be in-
Line 460: volved in this story. When each had selected a card, they all held them up at the
Line 461: same time.
Line 462: “Allan, I think you’re supposed to hold up only one card, not all of them. Did
Line 463: you have a hard time making up your mind?”
Line 464: “No, I don’t have a card big enough. So I’m holding them all up. All these
Line 465: cards”—the programmer indicated the 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 cards—“add up to 19.
Line 466: That seems about right.”
Line 467: “I’ve got some bigger cards—13, 20, 40, and 100,” Carlos said. He passed a
Line 468: set of the additional cards to each person. “I was hoping we wouldn’t need them,
Line 469: but we might.”
Line 470: “Why were you hoping we wouldn’t need these?”
Line 471: “Considering the stories that we’ve estimated so far, any story we estimate at
Line 472: 100 story points is not going to fit into a single iteration. It’s going to be too big.
Line 473: The same is probably true of the rest of the numbers I just passed out. It’s OK for
Line 474: us to have some big stories, and it’s perfectly fine for us to estimate them with
Line 475: big values. But we need to remember that we’ll have to split them up before
Line 476: working on them so that each fits into an iteration. And we need to remember
Line 477: that estimates of very large features are likely to be less accurate. That’s why the
Line 478: ranges get bigger.”
Line 479: “So, Allan, you think this is a nineteen. Really?” Sasha asked while double-
Line 480: checking the eight in her hand.
Line 481: “Absolutely. First, I need to learn more about this game. The engine is going
Line 482: to need to recognize whether the player is trying to make a ring, bridge, or fork.
Line 483: It’s going to have to decide which shape it should try to make. It needs to decide
Line 484: whether a move should be offensive or defensive. Even a first, weak engine is go-
Line 485: ing to take a while.”
Line 486: “Well, you’d know. But nineteen is huge,” Sasha said.
Line 487: “Prasad, why do you think this is a three?” Carlos asked, focusing the discus-
Line 488: sion on the estimators with the outlying values.
Line 489: “The testing just doesn’t sound hard. I don’t think I’ll have that much to do.
Line 490: I’ll create those text files for the tests, and that’s it.”
Line 491: “Sure but we’re estimating the full story, not just our own parts of it. Testing
Line 492: may be a three, but Allan’s time needs to be in there, too,” Carlos explained.
Line 493: “Oops. Yeah, then, Allan’s right,” Prasad said. “This one is going to be big.”
Line 494: “Let’s see if he’s right. Pick up your cards, and re-estimate based on what you
Line 495: just heard,” Carlos instructed. He paused a few seconds to make sure everyone
Line 496: had time to think. “Turn them over.”

Line 502: All cards showed twenty this time.
Line 503: “It looks like you convinced everyone, Allan,” Carlos said. “A twenty is prob-
Line 504: ably too big for one story, though. Allan, is there a way to split this story up?
Line 505: Maybe have an even weaker engine the first time? Then improve it before you
Line 506: ship.”
Line 507: “I don’t see any good ways,” Allan said. He thought for a moment and then
Line 508: continued, “We could have the engine play an offensive move every turn, always
Line 509: trying to make its own pattern, ignoring the human’s moves. I don’t think that’s
Line 510: a good idea, though.”
Line 511: “What if a first engine recognized only rings?” Rose asked. “We could take
Line 512: away bridges and forks—just for now. Allan, couldn’t you write an engine that
Line 513: played offensively and defensively but that tried to make—and block—only
Line 514: rings?”
Line 515: “Absolutely. That could work. So let’s split this into three stories—one for
Line 516: each shape.”
Line 517: Everyone agreed, and they estimated the three stories as shown in
Line 518: Table 23.4.
Line 519: “When those were one story, the estimate was twenty. Now it’s twenty-one.
Line 520: Should we take a point off of one story so it’s still twenty?” Frank asked.
Line 521: “No. The estimates are what they are, and they’re not meant to be that pre-
Line 522: cise,” Carlos answered. “Breaking stories up helps us see more of what’s in-
Line 523: volved. The sum of the estimates doesn’t need to equal the estimate of the larger
Line 524: story.”
Line 525: “Allan, what should we do about the medium-strength and strong engines?
Line 526: Do you want one story for each, or do you want to split those up by rings,
Line 527: bridges, and forks as well?”
Line 528: “One story each. I think that we should define our medium-strength engine
Line 529: as one that never makes an outright blunder,” Allan said. “It may not always play
Line 530: the absolute best move, but it never makes an outright mistake. We can test that
Line 531: the way we described, and we can have some good human players test it. As long

Line 546: as it makes moves that they would consider reasonable, it’s OK. For the strong
Line 547: engine, we can strengthen that condition and have it play the best move it can
Line 548: find. Based on performance, we can set how far ahead the move engine looks.”
Line 549: “So how do you want to write those as stories?” Frank asked.
Line 550: “I think As a player, I can play against a medium-strength engine is fine,”
Line 551: Delaney answered. 
Line 552: “Yes,” agreed Carlos. “You can note on the story card that ‘Always plays
Line 553: moves a good human player thinks are reasonable’ is one of the conditions of
Line 554: satisfaction for that story. That will help you remember what a ‘medium-
Line 555: strength engine’ is without having to make another story about reasonable
Line 556: moves.”
Line 557: The team discussed this story a bit more, played planning poker, and then
Line 558: agreed to estimate it as eight story points.
Line 559: “And then we’ll have As a player, I can play against a strong engine as well,
Line 560: I suppose,” Frank said.
Line 561: “This is at least twice as big as the medium engine,” Allan said. “We called
Line 562: that an eight. I don’t have a sixteen, though. Do we use thirteen? That’s the clos-
Line 563: est. Or do we make up a sixteen?”
Line 564: “What you want to do,” Carlos said, “is think of the cards as buckets. If this
Line 565: story is a sixteen, it won’t fit in a bucket that holds thirteen. We don’t want to
Line 566: make up new values because it starts to look too precise. We don’t know if this is
Line 567: a thirteen or a sixteen or a nineteen. It’s important to remember that these are
Line 568: estimates, not guarantees.”
Line 569: “OK, I think this is two to three times as big as the medium engine,” Allan
Line 570: said. “That means it’s sixteen to twenty-four. Because twenty-four won’t fit in a
Line 571: twenty bucket, should I estimate it as forty? That seems high. It’s not five times
Line 572: as big as the medium engine.”
Line 573: “No, I wouldn’t,” Carlos answered. “They’re buckets, but think of the con-
Line 574: tents as sand, not water. You can overfill it a tiny bit at the top.”
Line 575: “Let’s estimate, then,” Allan said.
Line 576: Based on the discussion they’d just heard, no one disagreed with Allan, and
Line 577: everyone held up a twenty.
Line 578: “So we’ll call this story a twenty,” Carlos said. “That’s OK for now. We’ll
Line 579: probably need to find a way to split it into at least two discrete pieces of work
Line 580: later.”
Line 581: “We don’t need to break it up into smaller stories, like we did for the weak
Line 582: engine?” Allan asked.

Line 588: “No, we can do that later, when we’re closer to working on that story,” Carlos
Line 589: said. “We’ll know more then, and there’s nothing to gain by splitting it today.”
Line 590: “Good. Let’s move on,” Delaney suggested. “The next story is As a player, I’d
Line 591: like to be able to use the system to play against another human on my com-
Line 592: puter. This referred to two of us sitting at one computer passing the keyboard or
Line 593: mouse back and forth and making moves. All we want is for the computer to tell
Line 594: us when someone wins.”
Line 595: “The other features we identified still work, though, right?” Prasad asked.
Line 596: “Two human players may want to use undo and redo, or they may want to ask for
Line 597: a hint.”
Line 598: “Sure,” Delaney answered.
Line 599: “I think we should add a story: As a player, I want the computer to recognize
Line 600: a winning shape,” Allan said. 
Line 601: “Isn’t that part of the move-engine stories?”
Line 602: “Yes, but if we pull it out we could do it separately and that would let us write
Line 603: a human-versus-human version of the game really quickly while we get the
Line 604: move engine working.”
Line 605: There were no objections, and the new story was estimated as two story
Line 606: points.
Line 607: “Allan, does that lower any of the estimates for the weak move-engine
Line 608: stories?” Frank asked.
Line 609: “Not really. I would still estimate each the way we have. We could lower the
Line 610: eight-point stories to seven, if you want.”
Line 611: “No, we don’t want to do that,” Carlos said. “That makes the numbers look
Line 612: too precise. If we want to lower it to a five, we can. Otherwise, let’s leave it as an
Line 613: eight.”
Line 614: “No, five is too low,” Allan said.
Line 615: “OK. So we’re back to estimating As a player, I’d like to be able to use the
Line 616: system to play against another human on my computer.”
Line 617: After two rounds of planning poker they reached agreement to call that story
Line 618: a three.
Line 619: “Next is As a player, I’d like the appearance of the game to be aesthetically
Line 620: pleasing,” Delaney read.
Line 621: “Finally. One of my stories,” Rose, the artist, said.
Line 622: “Yeah, except I don’t like the way this story is written,” Sasha said. “It’s kind
Line 623: of vague, and it’s big. I like the next story: As a player, I’d like to be able to

Line 625: --- 페이지 309 ---

Line 627: Chapter 23
Line 628: A Case Study: Bomb Shelter Studios
Line 629: choose between a wooden board and pieces and a metal board and pieces. What
Line 630: else did we mean by ‘aesthetically pleasing’?”
Line 631: “It had to do with the overall look and feel of the game,” Frank answered.
Line 632: “We probably won’t have many menus, but we want them to look good. We want
Line 633: the menu items to be in logical places. We want an attractive splash screen when
Line 634: the game loads. The board and pieces are the entire user interface. There will
Line 635: probably be some background art behind the game board. Rose needs time to do
Line 636: that.”
Line 637: “Those are good. Can we split some of those out as separate stories?” Sasha
Line 638: asked.
Line 639: “We could,” Delaney said, “but it might be hard. I think the menu items
Line 640: need to be developed in the context of whatever features introduce the need for a
Line 641: new menu or menu item. Rose, what do you think of having one story for a
Line 642: splash screen and another for background art?”
Line 643: “Fine with me. Obviously, I’d do them separately anyway.”
Line 644: The team made quick progress through the next set of stories.
Line 645: “What do we do about this story?” Prasad asked, pointing to a card that read
Line 646: As a player, I’d like to ask for a hint sometimes. 
Line 647: “What do you mean?”
Line 648: “If we’ve done the move engine, this story is really simple. All you do is ask
Line 649: the move engine to suggest a new move, but for the player instead of the com-
Line 650: puter. That would be trivial. But if we don’t have the move engine written, this
Line 651: story has to be at least as big as writing the whole move engine.”
Line 652: “So we have a dependency that we can do hints only after we’ve done the
Line 653: move engine,” Allan said.
Line 654: “Yes, but I don’t think that’s a problem in this case,” Sasha said. “Developing
Line 655: the move engine before the hint feature seems like the natural way to program
Line 656: those stories. The dependency won’t be in our way. We can ignore it. Or if we’re
Line 657: worried about forgetting this dependency, we can note it on the card. Either way,
Line 658: the story can be estimated with the assumption that the move engine exists.”
Line 659: Everyone agreed, and the story was estimated at one story point.
Line 660: “What would we have done if we really wanted to have hints before the move
Line 661: engine?”
Line 662: “Sometimes you can’t get rid of a dependency and you have to live with it,
Line 663: just like before you started using an agile process,” Carlos explained. “Most of
Line 664: the time, however, you can get rid of it. If we wanted to get rid of this depen-
Line 665: dency, you could write the code that lets a user ask for a hint, displays that hint,
Line 666: and makes the move for the user if she likes it. To get the hint, you would have
Line 667: 
Line 668: --- 페이지 310 ---
Line 669: Estimating the User Stories 
Line 670: |
Line 671: 279
Line 672: an object in the system called HintGenerator. Eventually, HintGenerator would
Line 673: call the move engine to get a good hint. But for now, you could have it return ei-
Line 674: ther the first open space or a random open space. That way, you’d be done with
Line 675: the hint story before even starting the move engine.”
Line 676: “We’d have to remember to come back later and make HintGenerator actu-
Line 677: ally call the move engine,” Allan said.
Line 678: “Yes,” Carlos said. “We could make another story that was something like As
Line 679: a player, I want to get good hints, rather than just hints.”
Line 680: “That’s probably a one-line change,” Allan said. “We’d delete whatever Hint-
Line 681: Generator does to find an empty space and call the move engine instead. We’d
Line 682: have to estimate that as a one, the same as the original story. It doesn’t seem like
Line 683: we’d gain anything.”
Line 684: “Ah,” Carlos said, “this is where it’s sometimes useful for us to have cards
Line 685: that say zero instead of just the numbers we have now. Because we have to come
Line 686: back and hook HintGenerator up to the right code, we want a story card so that
Line 687: we don’t forget. On the other hand, it really is so simple that we want to call it a
Line 688: zero.”
Line 689: Carlos gave each person another planning poker card, this time with a zero
Line 690: on it. “I’ve been holding on to these because I didn’t want you to use them before
Line 691: we talked about what a zero-point story would be.” Each person now held a deck
Line 692: of cards containing 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, and 100.
Line 693: “In this case, though, we’re going to add support for hints after the move en-
Line 694: gine is finished, though. Right?” asked Frank.
Line 695: “Yes, we’ll just keep that as a one-point story,” Sasha answered.
Line 696: Estimating continued in this fashion until the team had estimated each of
Line 697: the stories they had written. The stories and their estimates are shown in
Line 698: Table 23.5.
Line 699: “So where do we go from here? We need one more two-week iteration on
Line 700: Deep Black & White before we send it to the publisher,” Frank said.
Line 701: “While everyone else is working on that, I’m going to interview some likely
Line 702: buyers of this game,” Delaney said. “I want to see what features are the most im-
Line 703: portant.”
Line 704: “Will that take long?”
Line 705: “No, I’ll be done before the end of the iteration,” Delaney said. “Let’s meet
Line 706: again in two weeks, right after we ship Deep Black & White and after Frank takes
Line 707: us all out to celebrate finishing it.”
Line 708: “Sounds great. I’ll get right on that celebration. Are hamburgers OK,
Line 709: Delaney? Or should we splurge for pizza?”

Line 773: In the quiet of the early morning of the next day, Delaney sat at her desk in the
Line 774: team’s new open space, preparing the questionnaire she would use to interview
Line 775: prospective game buyers. Frank had asked to meet with her sometime during
Line 776: the day so she could explain to him how she was going to prioritize features. As
Line 777: the product manager, Frank would make the final decisions about what would be
Line 778: in the product, but Delaney knew that he would rely heavily on her research. She
Line 779: wanted to be prepared for meeting with him. By the time Frank arrived, Delaney
Line 780: had nearly finished the questionnaire.
Line 781: “Good morning, Delaney,” Frank greeted the analyst. “Do you still have time
Line 782: to get together this morning?”
Line 783: “Absolutely. I came in early to finish the questionnaire I want to send. I’d
Line 784: like to show it to you.”
Line 785: “Let’s do it,” Frank said as he pulled up a chair. “Show me what you’ve got.”
Line 786: As a player, I want to be able to quit the game.
Line 787: 1
Line 788: As a player, I want to restart the game so that I can give up and start over.
Line 789: 1
Line 790: As a new player, I want access to an online help system.
Line 791: 8
Line 792: As a player, I want all pieces of the winning shape to blink or glow so that I can 
Line 793: see the winning shape.
Line 794: 3
Line 795: As a new player, I’d like to be warned after making a horrible move and be given 
Line 796: the chance to take it back.
Line 797: 8
Line 798: As a new player, when it’s my turn to play I’d like to be shown any hex I should 
Line 799: play in, because if I don’t, the computer will play there next and win.
Line 800: 3
Line 801: As a player, I’d like the computer to play a move in no more than two seconds on 
Line 802: a 2.0GHz PC.

Line 804: As a player, I want the system to keep track of how many games I win and lose.

Line 820: “I printed this about a half-hour ago,” Delaney said as she handed Frank the
Line 821: page shown in Table 23.6. “I’ve added more questions since I printed that. But
Line 822: it’s enough to give you an idea of what I’ll send.”
Line 823: Frank reviewed the page Delaney had given him and then asked, “You seem
Line 824: to be asking each question twice. Why is that?”
Line 825: “The first form of the question is called the functional form; the second is
Line 826: the dysfunctional form to indicate it means a feature is not present. Asking these
Line 827: two questions gives us a better understanding than just asking ‘How much do
Line 828: you want this feature?’ It tells us how the user will feel if the feature is there and
Line 829: how he’ll feel if it isn’t.”
Line 830: “Can you give me an example of how that might be important?”
Line 831: “Sure. Suppose we ask, ‘How do you feel if you can undo and redo moves?’
Line 832: and a user says that she expects to be able to do that. We then ask her, ‘How do
Line 833: Table 23.6 The Beginnings of Delaney’s Questionnaire
Line 834: How do you feel if…
Line 835: I like it that way
Line 836: I expect it to be that way
Line 837: I am neutral
Line 838: I can live with it that way
Line 839: I dislike it that way
Line 840: …you can select to play against a fairly weak computer 
Line 841: opponent?
Line 842: …you can NOT select to play against a fairly weak com-
Line 843: puter opponent?
Line 844: …you can select to play against a medium-strength 
Line 845: computer opponent?
Line 846: …you can NOT select to play against a medium-
Line 847: strength computer opponent?
Line 848: …there is an interactive tutorial that helps you learn 
Line 849: how to play?
Line 850: …there is NOT an interactive tutorial that helps you

Line 856: 283
Line 857: you feel if you cannot undo and redo moves?’ and she says she would dislike that.
Line 858: That tells us that feature is mandatory for this user. She expects to be able to
Line 859: undo and redo; she dislikes it if she cannot.”
Line 860: “OK, I’m with you so far.”
Line 861: “Now suppose we ask the same user, ‘How do you feel if there is an interac-
Line 862: tive tutorial to help you learn the game?’ She likes that idea. We also ask the dys-
Line 863: functional form of that question, ‘How do you feel if there is not an interactive
Line 864: tutorial?’ and she says neutral on that. This is what we call an attractive feature,
Line 865: or an exciter. We’ve found a feature that the user didn’t expect to get or could
Line 866: live without. But she’s told us she’d like the feature. So we’ve learned this feature
Line 867: isn’t mandatory, but because it’s one she’d like, she may be willing to pay extra
Line 868: for it.”
Line 869: “But couldn’t we get that by asking users to rate the importance of features
Line 870: from one to five, like we did on Deep Black & White?” Frank asked.
Line 871: “Not really,” Delaney said. “A single scale like that just tells us how strongly
Line 872: a user values a feature. It doesn’t tell us how strongly the user would react to the
Line 873: absence of the feature. I wouldn’t prioritize wheels very highly if you asked me
Line 874: about features on a car, but I’d be mad if you took them away.”
Line 875: “Who are you going to give the questionnaire to?”
Line 876: “I’m going to email about 500 members of some game clubs I know where
Line 877: they play Havannah. Many are in Europe or in the larger U.S. cities. We’re offer-
Line 878: ing a coupon for $10 off one of our existing games to anyone who responds. I ex-
Line 879: pect to get fifty or so responses. I’m going to do some phone interviews as well.”
Line 880: “Isn’t this going to be a lot of questions for people to answer if you have two
Line 881: questions for each user story?” Frank asked.
Line 882: “Not really. I can group some of the user stories we identified into themes.
Line 883: For example, we’ve got two user stories about background music. They can be
Line 884: combined into a background music theme. I’ll combine the background-art and
Line 885: splash-screen stories into one theme about the game being aesthetically pleas-
Line 886: ing. Similarly, I’m not going to waste time asking about saving games and re-
Line 887: storing games. We know those are mandatory features.”
Line 888: “That’s great. I want to make sure this stays lightweight and easy. How will
Line 889: we use the answers you get?”
Line 890: “I want to separate our features into three categories. First are features we
Line 891: must have. These are cost-of-entry features like saving and restoring games. The
Line 892: second category is features that the more we have of them, the better. I suspect
Line 893: things like playing levels will be in this category. The more playing levels—like
Line 894: strong, medium, and weak—the better. The third category is the exciters. These

Line 897: 284 |
Line 898: Chapter 23
Line 899: A Case Study: Bomb Shelter Studios
Line 900: are features that most users don’t expect, but once they see them, they want
Line 901: them. The right mix of features from the latter two categories plus all the neces-
Line 902: sary must-have features can add up to a compelling product.”
Line 903: Before Frank could respond, Allan rolled his chair next to Frank and
Line 904: Delaney. “Good morning,” he said. “I couldn’t help but overhear part of that. It
Line 905: sounds really interesting. Will the rest of the team have access to the results of
Line 906: your interviews?”
Line 907: “Absolutely, Allan.”
Line 908: “Good. You know, I might even want to listen in on one or two of your phone
Line 909: interviews to hear what users have to say. Would that be OK?” Allan asked.
Line 910: “Absolutely,” said Delaney. “Understanding our audience is something the
Line 911: whole team really benefits from. The more that you or the other techies want to
Line 912: be involved in this, the better from my perspective. I’ll benefit from your in-
Line 913: sights, and you’ll benefit from hearing what the customers say.”
Line 914: “I agree,” Allan said. “I can’t do any calls with you today. I need to fix a bug
Line 915: in the scoring engine of Deep Black & White. But any other day this week when
Line 916: you’re making calls, let me know.”
Line 917: “I’ll do that,” Delaney said.
Line 918: “It sounds like you’ve got a solid plan worked out,” Frank said. “This is excit-
Line 919: ing. Will you still have some results next week?”
Line 920: “Definitely. The IT group is going to put the questionnaire on our website
Line 921: tomorrow. We could start getting preliminary results any time after that.”
Line 922: “Great. Thanks for showing this to me,” Frank said as he got up and excused
Line 923: himself.
Line 924: Iteration and Release Planning, Round 1
Line 925: Two weeks after the meeting in which they wrote and estimated user stories, the
Line 926: team again assembled in a conference room adjoining their open workspace. By
Line 927: nine, the whole team was present, even Rose who had begun dropping Brooke at
Line 928: preschool five minutes earlier so that she would be in the office by the time the
Line 929: team started their daily standup meetings.
Line 930: “We have three goals for today,” Carlos began. “First, we’re going to plan
Line 931: your initial two-week iteration. After that, Delaney is going to tell us what she
Line 932: found during her product research about what prospective buyers want. Finally,
Line 933: we’re going to take an initial very rough guess at what your release plan and
Line 934: schedule may look like. Any questions?”

Line 940: Sasha waited a few seconds to see whether there were any questions. There
Line 941: weren’t.
Line 942: Planning the First Iteration
Line 943: “So what should we develop first?” Rose asked.
Line 944: “I want to get started on the move engine,” Allan said. “That’s our biggest
Line 945: risk.”
Line 946: “No argument from me,” Sasha, the other programmer on the team, said.
Line 947: “Are there things I can do to help, Allan? Normally, all of the artificial intelli-
Line 948: gence work is yours.”
Line 949: “Yeah, there are things you can do. Thanks,” Allan said. “That would help me
Line 950: a lot, because I’m worried about how hard it might be to do the strong engine.”
Line 951: “So let’s start with the story As a player, I can play against a weak engine
Line 952: that recognizes rings. Isn’t that the one you want to do first, Allan?” Delaney
Line 953: asked.
Line 954: “Yes, it is. The first thing we need to do is code the classes that will keep
Line 955: track of the state of the board, keep track of whose turn it is, and stuff like that.
Line 956: Sasha, you can definitely help there.”
Line 957: “OK. How long do you think it will take? A couple of days?”
Line 958: “A couple of solid days. Let’s say sixteen hours,” Allan answered.
Line 959: “Allan, we want to capture each task on a note card. Write that on a card, and
Line 960: put sixteen in the corner of the card so we don’t forget the estimate,” Carlos said.
Line 961: Allan wrote Task Card 23.1.
Line 962: “Should I put my initials on it so we remember this is my card?”
Line 963: “No. It sounds like you’ll probably be the one to do it. But it works better if
Line 964: we don’t assign work to specific individuals right now.”
Line 965: “I’m going to need to test this,” Prasad said. “It shouldn’t take long, but this
Line 966: is the first code on this project, and I want to make sure I set it up right. I’m go-
Line 967: ing to say testing will take ten hours.”
Line 968: Code state management classes.

Line 975: A Case Study: Bomb Shelter Studios
Line 976: He wrote Task Card 23.2.
Line 977: “Carlos, you told me earlier I need to break my work up into small pieces,”
Line 978: Allan said. “I can’t just say that writing the move engine for rings will take two
Line 979: weeks, can I?”
Line 980: “No, you can’t. When we’re identifying tasks, we want them to be around one
Line 981: to sixteen hours. Ideally, you should be able to finish one each day, which means
Line 982: the average should be like five or six hours, because we always have a few other
Line 983: things to do each day.”
Line 984: “In that case,” Allan said, “the way I plan to write this is to first have a move
Line 985: engine that will be smart enough to play six hexagons in a row to make a ring.
Line 986: There won’t be an opponent trying to stop the engine. I’ll have the engine start
Line 987: in a random place on the board and figure out how to make a ring in six moves.
Line 988: Next, I’ll write it so that it tries to make a ring even if an opponent tries to block
Line 989: the ring. Then I’ll switch to the defensive side of rings. I’ll have the engine try to
Line 990: block another player that is trying to make a ring. That’ll be it for this story for
Line 991: me.”
Line 992: “OK, I wrote a task card that says Have move engine pursue an unblocked
Line 993: ring. That’s what you said you wanted to do first,” Sasha said.
Line 994: “That’ll probably take me most of a day. Put six hours on that card, please,”
Line 995: Allan said.
Line 996: “Allan, no offense, but you are always optimistic at the start of a new en-
Line 997: gine,” Rose, the artist, said. 
Line 998: “Yeah, you’re right. You’d better double that,” Allan agreed.
Line 999: Sasha crossed out the six and wrote twelve hours on the card. 
Line 1000: Carlos then led the discussion through estimates of the other tasks Allan
Line 1001: had identified. “Are there other tasks we haven’t identified for this story?” he
Line 1002: asked.
Line 1003: “We might want to include some time for testing!” Prasad said. “If Allan can
Line 1004: give me code after each of the tasks he identified, I can define and automate tests
Line 1005: right along with him. Any bugs I find, he’ll hear about while the code is fresh in

Line 1014: his mind. I wrote the tasks on cards while Allan was describing how he’ll code
Line 1015: this, but I haven’t estimated them yet. Can we do that together now?”
Line 1016: When they finished discussing the As a player, I can play against a weak en-
Line 1017: gine that recognizes rings story, they had written the task cards summarized in
Line 1018: Table 23.7.
Line 1019: “That’s about eighty-four hours in this iteration. The work is split across Al-
Line 1020: lan, Sasha, and Prasad,” Carlos said. “Based on what I’ve seen after being here a
Line 1021: couple of days, I think you should plan on six hours per day per person of pro-
Line 1022: ductive work. The rest of each day goes to answering emails, talking to other
Line 1023: project teams, your own daily meetings, the half day every other week we’ll
Line 1024: spend doing this planning, and so on.”
Line 1025: “Six seems reasonable to me.”
Line 1026: “Me, too. It might be closer to five, but I can try to get six a day on this
Line 1027: project and figure out how to make that happen by not doing some of the other
Line 1028: little things that chew up my time every day,” Sasha said.
Line 1029: “Now that you’ve split that first story into tasks,” Carlos said, “the question
Line 1030: you need to ask yourselves is whether you can commit to finishing the story.”
Line 1031: “The story or the tasks?” Frank asked. “Which are we committing to?”

Line 1061: “Good question, Frank,” Carlos said. “You commit to the story. We identify
Line 1062: the tasks as a way of seeing how much work is involved and of helping us make
Line 1063: the commitment. Because you’re committing to the story, not just the tasks, it’s
Line 1064: important that you think about this as a whole-team commitment. At the end of
Line 1065: the iteration, I don’t want Sasha to say she’s done with the state management
Line 1066: classes but that Allan isn’t done. That wouldn’t do you any good. You can think
Line 1067: about tasks, but you commit to stories.”
Line 1068: “Interesting,” Frank said. “I like the distinction.”
Line 1069: “I can commit to this story,” Prasad said. “I’ve got thirty-six hours of testing
Line 1070: tasks. With six hours a day for ten days, I’ve got sixty hours available.”
Line 1071: “And between Allan and me, we have forty-eight hours of tasks. That won’t
Line 1072: be a problem,” Sasha said. 
Line 1073: “Great. We’ve got our first story planned, and we’ve committed to it,” Frank
Line 1074: said. “Let’s move on to the next most important story.”
Line 1075: “Frank, before we do that, let’s list everyone’s availability for the next two
Line 1076: weeks,” Carlos said. “We’ve said we’ll assume six hours per day, but is anyone
Line 1077: planning any vacation or any time out of the office?”
Line 1078: “I’m taking two days off. I’ve got a couple of paintings in a show up in San
Line 1079: Francisco, so I want to head up there for that,” Rose said. 
Line 1080: “I’ll probably take one day off. Either a Friday or a Monday,” said Allan.
Line 1081: “My mom and dad are going to be in town next week. Too much time with
Line 1082: them drives me nuts, so I’ll be working extra!” Delaney joked.
Line 1083: During this, Carlos had taken the notes shown in Table 23.8 on the white-
Line 1084: board in the front of the room. “This will help us know how much we can com-
Line 1085: mit to as we identify the next few stories we’ll work on,” Carlos explained.

Line 1102: “Thanks, Carlos,” Frank said. “What’s the next most important thing to do?” 
Line 1103: “I’d really like to have the game play human versus human,” Delaney said.
Line 1104: “That’s a good step,” Allan agreed. “It would make us program the logic that
Line 1105: recognizes when the game has been won. We could easily add the undo and redo
Line 1106: features while I get a suitable first move engine programmed.”
Line 1107: “Let’s break As a player, I’d like to be able to use the system to play against

Line 1109: Everyone agreed. When they were done, they had identified the tasks listed
Line 1110: in Table 23.9.
Line 1111: “So as a team, can you commit to completing this story in addition to the
Line 1112: first one?” Carlos asked.
Line 1113: “Wait—doesn’t this story encompass another story we wrote? We have one
Line 1114: that says As a player, I want the computer to recognize a winning shape. We’ve
Line 1115: included that as part of playing against a human,” Prasad said. “Should we re-
Line 1116: move it?”
Line 1117: “I don’t know yet. We included it by accident. Let’s see if we can commit to
Line 1118: the work we just identified. If we can’t, we can remove having the computer rec-
Line 1119: ognize winning shapes and let the players decide when a game is over,” Delaney
Line 1120: said. “What do you think? Can we commit to this story, too?”
Line 1121: “Yes,” Allan and Sasha said nearly in unison.
Line 1122: “Seems fine to me,” Rose said.

Line 1148: “Keep in mind, testing tasks are not assigned specifically to you, Prasad,”
Line 1149: Carlos said. “Anyone can do them. If you fall a little behind, others will be ex-
Line 1150: pected to pick up testing tasks.”
Line 1151: “Absolutely. I usually do some testing,” said Rose. “I want to start on some

Line 1197: “Can we commit to this story, too?” Rose asked.
Line 1198: Frank noticed and appreciated that this was one of the team members ask-
Line 1199: ing her peers if they could commit. He liked that so much better than asking
Line 1200: them himself, as the product manager, “Can you commit?”
Line 1201: “I’ve been adding these up as we go,” Sasha said, rising from her chair.
Line 1202: “Here’s how I’ve added them up.” She drew Table 23.11.
Line 1203: “I don’t know about the rest of you, but I can commit to four hours over the
Line 1204: next two weeks,” Rose joked.
Line 1205: “With two programmers each getting thirty hours a week and doing a two-
Line 1206: week iteration, I think we’re OK on the programming side,” Sasha said.
Line 1207: “I agree,” Allan said.
Line 1208: “I don’t feel comfortable taking on any more, though,” Sasha said. “And be-
Line 1209: sides, that’s too much testing for just Prasad.”
Line 1210: “I plan to help with some testing,” Rose said.
Line 1211: “Me, too,” Delaney said. “I probably can’t do any of the automation, but I can
Line 1212: help specify good test cases.”

Line 1250: “I’d like to add a few more tasks to the iteration, just to make sure we ac-
Line 1251: count for them,” Delaney said. “I really need to do a few more player interviews.
Line 1252: We haven’t talked about my product research yet, but a few things came up that
Line 1253: I want to follow up on. Adding twelve hours or so for me of additional product
Line 1254: research would be great. I can still spend most of my time on testing, though.”
Line 1255: “And I’d like to do some preliminary board and piece drawings so we can get
Line 1256: those circulating. It always takes a while to get enough feedback on those. I’d
Line 1257: like to draw four board and piece sets at four hours each.”
Line 1258: “Those seem reasonable to me,” Frank said. “Let’s add those.”
Line 1259: “So with everything we’ve listed, are we all comfortable committing to this?”
Line 1260: Sasha asked. “It’s 224 hours in total now. With five of us on the project—Allan,
Line 1261: Prasad, Rose, Delaney, and me—this works out closer to five hours a day. But
Line 1262: that’s if all the work and each of us is interchangeable. We’re not.”
Line 1263: “And besides,” Carlos said, “you’re better off adding something midway
Line 1264: through the iteration than dropping something.”
Line 1265: Everyone agreed that the level of effort was just right—not too hard, not too
Line 1266: soft, just right. Everyone committed that as a team, they would deliver those
Line 1267: three stories in two weeks.
Line 1268: “Fantastic,” Frank said. “It is great to think that we’ll make so much visible
Line 1269: progress so quickly. Normally, it takes much longer before we have anything to
Line 1270: show.”
Line 1271: “Let’s take a fifteen-minute break,” Carlos said. “When we come back, I want
Line 1272: to move on to the second goal for this meeting: release planning. I want to have
Line 1273: some initial guess as to how long we think this project will take.”
Line 1274: Release Planning
Line 1275: When everyone returned and was seated around the table, Frank began the
Line 1276: meeting. “Delaney, tell us about the product research and what you found.”
Line 1277: “What I did,” Delaney said, “was send out just over 500 email invitations to
Line 1278: complete a web-based questionnaire. I also spoke on the phone with thirty-five-
Line 1279: likely buyers of a game such as this. In total, we got answers from seventy-eight
Line 1280: prospective buyers. The purpose of the survey was to find out which features
Line 1281: we’ve identified are mandatory; they just need to be in the game. We also want to
Line 1282: learn which features are exciting. They may not need to be in the game, but in-
Line 1283: cluding a few exciters really makes a game more appealing and may let us charge
Line 1284: a higher price for it. Finally, there are some features we call linear. The more of
Line 1285: a linear feature present in a product, the more people will pay for it. Examples of
Line 1286: linear features are horsepower in a car, the number of channels on satellite TV,

Line 1291: 293
Line 1292: and the number of playing levels in a game. I won’t explain here exactly how I
Line 1293: did the research. But if you’re interested, I can point you to a chapter in a book
Line 1294: [see Chapter 11, “Prioritizing Desirability”]. I’ve summarized the results,
Line 1295: though, on this page,” Delaney concluded as she distributed pages showing
Line 1296: Table 23.12.
Line 1297: “Delaney, there are a lot fewer items here than we have stories,” Prasad said.
Line 1298: “How come?”
Line 1299: “The longer the questionnaire, the lower the response rate,” Delaney said.
Line 1300: “So I merged stories based on my judgment. For example, ‘aesthetically pleasing’

Line 1415: look. On the other hand, if I combine too many stories into one question, the an-
Line 1416: swers we get back may not be very useful.”
Line 1417: “I can relate the first three columns to your descriptions of the three types of
Line 1418: features, Delaney. But what do ‘indifferent,’ ‘reverse,’ and ‘questionable’ mean?”
Line 1419: Rose asked.
Line 1420: “Good question. Indifferent is easy; it just means that the person didn’t have
Line 1421: a strong preference either way,” Delaney answered. “Because of how the ques-
Line 1422: tions are presented, it’s possible for us to not be able to interpret an occasional
Line 1423: opinion. For example, this could happen if someone said they dislike background
Line 1424: music but that they also dislike it when there’s no background music. That hap-
Line 1425: pens; people get confused or misinterpret questions when rushing. You’ll notice
Line 1426: the percentages for reverse and questionable are pretty low.”
Line 1427: “Delaney, am I reading this right?” Rose asked. “It says that weak and me-
Line 1428: dium-strength opponents are mandatory. But you’ve said that a strong opponent
Line 1429: is both indifferent and mandatory. How can that be? Why not pick the answer
Line 1430: with the highest percentage?”
Line 1431: “Yes, weak and medium opponents are mandatory. The reason we see two
Line 1432: spikes in the values for a strong opponent is that we are probably selling into two
Line 1433: audiences—those who already play Havannah and are good at it and those who
Line 1434: aren’t. Those who are good at it consider a strong opponent as mandatory if
Line 1435: they’re going to buy. Newer players are telling us they’ll be happy with a me-
Line 1436: dium-strength player.”
Line 1437: “What strikes me, Delaney, is that there aren’t many features on this list that
Line 1438: your audience considered exciting,” Frank said as more question than state-
Line 1439: ment.
Line 1440: “True. But just because there aren’t many exciters doesn’t mean the product
Line 1441: itself won’t be exciting,” the analyst answered. “Remember that exciters are un-
Line 1442: expected features. If I got into a new Porsche, there’s probably very little in there
Line 1443: that would truly be unexpected. But the car itself would still be very exciting. But
Line 1444: I agree with the point I think you were making. We haven’t identified all the fea-
Line 1445: tures this product needs. Every product should have at least one or two excit-
Line 1446: ers—stuff that really makes the user say, ‘Wow!’ The survey seems to be saying
Line 1447: we haven’t found that yet. This is why I asked for time in the coming iteration to
Line 1448: follow up on this research. I want to have a few open-ended discussions with
Line 1449: some of the survey participants. I’m hopeful that will help us find an exciter or
Line 1450: two.”
Line 1451: “This is great, Delaney. Very helpful,” Frank said. “Does anyone have any
Line 1452: more questions for her?” Frank paused before continuing. “If not, let’s talk about
Line 1453: what we need in a release of Havannah.”

Line 1459: No one had any additional questions. They immediately plunged into plan-

Line 1461: “Here are the stories I considered mandatory and didn’t even bother asking

Line 1463: the conference room table. The story cards and estimates she included are
Line 1464: shown in Table 23.13.
Line 1465: “None of these stories should be surprising,” Delaney continued. “We see
Line 1466: these features in every game we make. Supporting them is really the cost of
Line 1467: entry.”
Line 1468: Delaney grabbed another set of cards. “On this part of the table, I’m going to
Line 1469: arrange the stories that our customers told us are mandatory.” In that group,

Line 1510: “Delaney, why do you include the strong engine in there?” Allan asked. “I
Line 1511: like that. But according to what you showed us a few minutes ago, it was consid-
Line 1512: ered both a mandatory feature and one users were indifferent to.”
Line 1513: “Good observation, Allan,” Delaney said. “I’m making the recommendation
Line 1514: that we consider that feature mandatory because I think many users will out-
Line 1515: grow what you’re defining as the medium-strength engine. Those users will get
Line 1516: bored with the game if we don’t include the strong engine.”
Line 1517: “OK.”
Line 1518: Frank was enjoying this. In his role as product manager and Delaney’s as the
Line 1519: analyst, the team had often left all the product definition up to them. He liked
Line 1520: that they were engaged in these discussions and were attentive to what was be-
Line 1521: ing discussed. That could only help the new product. 
Line 1522: “The other story I’ve included as mandatory that is worth discussing is As a

Line 1524: my computer. I’ve included that as mandatory because we’ve already said it’s a

Line 1557: “Art isn’t optional,” said Rose. “We need a nice splash screen and attractive
Line 1558: boards and backgrounds.”
Line 1559: “I didn’t say these are optional, Rose,” Delaney said. “You’re right—we do
Line 1560: need these. There is a certain baseline we can’t fall below, and the game does
Line 1561: need to be aesthetically pleasing, which is how I asked the question on the sur-
Line 1562: vey. These are linear, because the more of them, the better. Two board choices
Line 1563: are better than one, but three would be even better.”
Line 1564: “OK. That makes sense,” Frank said. “You’ve still got some story cards in
Line 1565: front of you. What type of stories are those?”
Line 1566: “These next cards are exciters. Likely buyers don’t expect any one of these,
Line 1567: but we should include a couple because they really boost enjoyment of the game.

Line 1601: “Wow,” Frank said. “This is more information than we normally have at this
Line 1602: point. Great job, Delaney. You got all this from your surveys?”
Line 1603: “Yes. The questionnaire is intentionally lightweight and just asks users how
Line 1604: they’d feel if a feature was present and how they’d feel if it was not present. Be-
Line 1605: cause I combined some of our individual user stories into themes, the question-
Line 1606: naire had only twenty-four questions on it. Including some chitchat, it took only
Line 1607: about fifteen minutes over the phone. Our website tracked the time it took each
Line 1608: respondent to fill out the form. The average time was seven minutes. One person
Line 1609: took forty, but I suspect they walked away from it or took a phone call.”
Line 1610: “So, Frank, what are our priorities?” Sasha asked.

Line 1614: “Of the features Delaney said are linear, I agree with Rose: We need nice art-
Line 1615: work,” Frank said. “All of those stories should be in. And I can’t see going with-
Line 1616: out background music. Maybe the user can’t change songs, but that’s only one
Line 1617: point, so for now, I’m going to say we want it. And we need online help. Not ev-

Line 1649: “So you want all of the linear features. That’s another thirty-two points,”
Line 1650: said Sasha.
Line 1651: “I know. I want it all, right? Just like every product manager in the world.”
Line 1652: “I don’t mind; I just know you want the product out in four months. We’re
Line 1653: up to 120 story points now.”
Line 1654: “Will that take more than four months?” Frank asked, a bit concerned.
Line 1655: “I have no idea yet. Let’s figure out what you want, and then we can see how
Line 1656: long it will take,” Sasha said.
Line 1657: “Fair enough,” Frank said. “Of the exciters, I think we need hints, and I’d
Line 1658: like the tutorial. Maybe we could drop it or the online help, but I want to plan on
Line 1659: both. I like the idea of telling the user when she’s made a bad move right after
Line 1660: she makes it.”
Line 1661: “Remember, that’s an eight-point story,” Allan reminded everyone. “I’m pro-
Line 1662: gramming the move engine to find good moves. I can enhance it to find really
Line 1663: bad moves, but it’s not trivial.”
Line 1664: “That’s what I’m looking at. Let’s plan on going without that for now. But
Line 1665: let’s include the story about warning the player that she’s about to lose unless
Line 1666: she plays in a particular hexagon to block the computer.”
Line 1667: “That’s twelve points from the exciters list. Do you want anything from the
Line 1668: indifferent list?” Sasha asked. 
Line 1669: “Not really,” Frank said. “What’s our total now?”
Line 1670: “You’ve got eighty-eight story points from the mandatory lists, thirty-two
Line 1671: from the linear list, and twelve from the exciters. That’s a total of 132,” Sasha
Line 1672: said.
Line 1673: “And you’ll do all that in two iterations, right?” Frank asked with a smile.
Line 1674: “If we could, we would.”
Line 1675: “Seriously, how do we know how long that will take?”
Line 1676: “The best thing would be to wait three iterations and answer you then,” Car-
Line 1677: los explained. “After each iteration, we can add up the story points for the stories
Line 1678: that are finished. We call that velocity. Velocity will change from iteration to it-
Line 1679: eration, but its average is relatively stable over time.”
Line 1680: “Yes,” Allan jumped in, “our estimates may have been off. Or we may get
Line 1681: lucky, or unlucky, on a story.”
Line 1682: “After three iterations, we should have a good measure of how fast the team
Line 1683: is progressing. We can divide the total amount of work remaining by the velocity,
Line 1684: and that will tell us how long to expect,” Carlos said.
Line 1685: “And that estimate will be pretty good?” Frank asked.

Line 1691: “It should be. After three iterations, you’ll have a good feel for how many
Line 1692: story points you can do in a two-week iteration,” Carlos said.
Line 1693: “We do need to keep in mind that I’m going to talk to some more potential
Line 1694: buyers and see if I can find any more exciters,” Delaney said. “As we said earlier,
Line 1695: our exciters seem weak. We may add some more features.”
Line 1696: “Is there any way to get an expected schedule now?”
Line 1697: “Sure, Frank,” Carlos said. “You’ve planned to do four stories in this first it-
Line 1698: eration. We can add up the points associated with each and call that our planned
Line 1699: velocity. We have no idea if it will be, but it’s our initial guess.”
Line 1700: “I’ve already done that,” Prasad said. “It’s eighteen. We get eight points for
Line 1701: As a player, I can play against a weak engine that recognizes rings. We get five
Line 1702: points for As a player, I can play against a weak engine that recognizes bridges.
Line 1703: Then we get two points for As a player, I want the computer to recognize a win-
Line 1704: ning shape and three points for As a player, I’d like to be able to use the system
Line 1705: to play against another human on my computer.”
Line 1706: “How many iterations will the project take if our velocity is eighteen?”
Line 1707: “Just over seven iterations. We’ve got 132 points. Seven times eighteen is
Line 1708: 126. We’re six points over seven iterations,” Prasad said.
Line 1709: “Can we just call it seven iterations?” Frank asked.
Line 1710: “We could, but we shouldn’t,” Carlos replied. “I’d prefer to give the estimate
Line 1711: as a range. If we’re looking at enough work to go into an eighth iteration, we
Line 1712: should probably say the project will take six to ten iterations.”
Line 1713: “I really don’t want this project to take twenty weeks. But you’re saying it
Line 1714: might take only twelve, right?” Frank asked.
Line 1715: “It might. But it might take twenty.” Carlos remained firm. “You can help it
Line 1716: avoid taking twenty weeks by removing your lowest-priority features if velocity
Line 1717: shows that we’re headed toward ten iterations. Keep in mind, too, that Delaney
Line 1718: is actively looking for more features. If she comes up with something, we’ll have
Line 1719: to extend the schedule or take the same amount of current features out.”
Line 1720: “OK, I can explain twelve to twenty weeks to the other executives,” Frank
Line 1721: said. “Let’s go with that as our initial plan.”
Line 1722: “Frank, I need to reiterate that the best thing to do would be to wait at least
Line 1723: two weeks, let the team run one iteration, and then base this initial plan off at
Line 1724: least one observation of actual velocity,” Carlos said.
Line 1725: “Understood. But everyone wants to know at least an idea of what the sched-
Line 1726: ule looks like for this project.”

Line 1732: “Make sure they know that we can provide better information every two
Line 1733: weeks. Especially after these first three iterations, we should know a lot more,”
Line 1734: Prasad added.
Line 1735: “So do we need to plan what will be worked on in each iteration?” Frank
Line 1736: asked.
Line 1737: “Not really,” Carlos answered. “The most important thing is to know what is
Line 1738: going to be worked on next. We did that when we planned the iteration. The next
Line 1739: most important thing is to know those features at the bottom of the list that may
Line 1740: or may not make it into the release.”
Line 1741: “I understand why you need to know the top priorities, but why the bottom
Line 1742: ones?” Frank said.
Line 1743: “It’s not very important for this first meeting, but when we get close to the
Line 1744: end of the release, it’s sometimes important. For example, we wouldn’t want
Line 1745: marketing to design packaging that said ‘Now with background music’ if that’s a
Line 1746: feature that may get dropped at the last minute.”
Line 1747: “OK, but why not spend some time today planning what we’ll do in each it-
Line 1748: eration?”
Line 1749: “No point,” Carlos said. “In two weeks, we’ll know so much more than we do
Line 1750: today. Why plan what we’ll do in an iteration until we have to? We don’t have to.
Line 1751: On a larger project, particularly with multiple teams that need to coordinate
Line 1752: work, we might look ahead two or three iterations. But we don’t need to do that
Line 1753: on this project.”
Line 1754: “So are we done with release planning, then?” Frank asked.
Line 1755: “Yes. I’ll stack up the story cards you said you really want in the release, and
Line 1756: that’s our plan,” Carlos said. “Before we get together again, two weeks from to-
Line 1757: day, you and Delaney should talk about the stories and identify the ones you’d
Line 1758: most like to see in the next iteration. In the meeting, we’ll talk about why you
Line 1759: want those stories. The others may ask you to reconsider and move in one or two
Line 1760: that they want to do because they’re risky or because they’ll learn a lot by doing
Line 1761: them. But the ultimate prioritization decision will be up to you.”
Line 1762: “Don’t take this the wrong way,” Frank said, “but it didn’t really feel up to
Line 1763: me today.”
Line 1764: “It was,” Carlos said, “but selecting the right things to work on next is really
Line 1765: a whole-team effort. If the programmers were selecting a bunch of technical
Line 1766: mumbo-jumbo or features you wouldn’t be able to see, I would have stopped that
Line 1767: and had them work on other stories. I assume you’re happy with the stories that
Line 1768: were selected?”
Line 1769: “Ecstatic. It will be great to see all that in two weeks.”

Line 1776: “I wish we could have finished everything. Still, I’m impressed with what we’ve
Line 1777: got,” Sasha said to the others while waiting for the meeting to begin.
Line 1778: “It’s unfortunate that we had to drop the As a player, I want the computer to
Line 1779: recognize a winning shape story. But I really needed your help on the move- en-
Line 1780: gine code, Sasha. Thanks,” Allan thanked the other programmer. 
Line 1781: “Not a problem, Allan. We’re all in this together, and being able to demon-
Line 1782: strate an engine that makes rings and bridges is more important,” Sasha said.
Line 1783: “So are we ready for the demo?” Frank asked as he walked into the room
Line 1784: promptly at nine. He laid a box of bagels on the large table.
Line 1785: “Absolutely,” Sasha said. “Do you know if any of the other executives or
Line 1786: other project members are coming to watch the iteration review?”
Line 1787: “I know Phil and Laura said they’d be here,” Frank said, referring to the chief
Line 1788: executive officer and the chief financial officer.
Line 1789: “And a couple of the engineers on other teams said they’d be here as well.
Line 1790: They’re curious about our new agile development process,” Allan said.
Line 1791: Over the course of the next half-hour, the team showed what they’d com-
Line 1792: pleted. They demonstrated the game engine making rings and bridges. They
Line 1793: showed how two humans could play against each other, trading the keyboard be-
Line 1794: tween them to make moves. They’d even hooked the two pieces of functionality
Line 1795: together so that a human could play against the computer. The human usually
Line 1796: won, but that wasn’t surprising against the easy move engine.
Line 1797: The graphics were rudimentary—just Rose’s quick illustrations. But Phil,
Line 1798: the CEO, was ecstatic to see that after only two weeks, some small part of the
Line 1799: game had been developed and was functional. He was even more pleased when
Line 1800: Prasad handed him the keyboard and he was able to play the game himself,
Line 1801: barely winning the new game.
Line 1802: “This is fantastic, everyone,” Phil announced, rising from his seat. “Every
Line 1803: two weeks, you’ll show more?”
Line 1804: “Absolutely. Every other week, right here at nine,” Sasha said.
Line 1805: “I’ll be back next time. I’m going to put these meetings on my schedule. This
Line 1806: thirty minutes of seeing the actual software working is more useful than any sta-
Line 1807: tus report I ever read. And how’s your schedule? Can I ask that now?”
Line 1808: “You can,” Frank said. “Right now, we’re sticking by our estimate of twelve
Line 1809: to twenty weeks. We’re going to plan the next iteration after this meeting. We’ll
Line 1810: know more in two to four weeks. At that time, we should be able to commit to a
Line 1811: schedule that we can tell publishers about.”

Line 1817: “Great,” Phil replied. He and Laura left the conference room. So did the half-
Line 1818: dozen others who had come to see the project.
Line 1819: Planning the Second Iteration
Line 1820: “If I recall correctly,” Frank said, “we planned a velocity of eighteen story
Line 1821: points.”
Line 1822: “Correct,” said Delaney.
Line 1823: “But we couldn’t finish the story about recognizing when the game had been
Line 1824: won. So our velocity is less than eighteen. Do we give ourselves one point for do-
Line 1825: ing half of that story?” Frank asked.
Line 1826: “No,” Carlos said. “In general, we want to apply an all-or-nothing approach
Line 1827: to the story points. It’s too hard to give ourselves partial credit, because we really
Line 1828: don’t know how much work is left. Rather than guessing, we don’t get any credit
Line 1829: until we get it all.”
Line 1830: “So our velocity was sixteen, because we originally estimated the unfinished
Line 1831: story as two points,” Rose said.
Line 1832: “We have to plan on the project taking longer. Right?” Frank asked.
Line 1833: “We’re still within the twelve to twenty weeks you told the executives,”
Line 1834: Sasha said. “We started with 132 story points. We finished 16, so we have 116
Line 1835: left. Dividing 116 by 16, our velocity, gives us 7.25. To be safe, let’s call that eight
Line 1836: more two-week iterations. Including the two weeks we just spent, that’s a total of
Line 1837: eighteen weeks.”
Line 1838: “That’s two weeks longer than four months, Frank. Does that matter?”
Line 1839: Prasad asked.
Line 1840: “Not really. The release isn’t tied to any specific date. We just want it out as
Line 1841: soon as possible,” Frank said. “I haven’t had a chance to tell you this yet: We still
Line 1842: haven’t finalized the contract for Deep Black & White with the Japanese pub-
Line 1843: lisher. They still want to publish the game. And we’re this close to signing the fi-
Line 1844: nal contract.” He held his fingers millimeters apart. “But they don’t want to
Line 1845: release it until they have time to gear up a big marketing campaign, with ads in
Line 1846: all the major magazines. That’s probably four months. And the way that works,
Line 1847: we won’t see any royalties until the quarter after the game is released. We could
Line 1848: be looking at eight months before Deep Black & White brings any real money in
Line 1849: the door. Ideally, Havannah could be a quick win for us. Not on the scale of Deep
Line 1850: Black & White. But because it won’t need the marketing ramp-up, the revenue
Line 1851: will be more immediate.”

Line 1857: “And Frank, I’m sorry, but because I had to do more testing than I expected,
Line 1858: I didn’t do much product research during this iteration,” Delaney said.
Line 1859: “OK. That’s fine, but let’s make that a priority this time, even if it means you
Line 1860: test less,” Frank said.
Line 1861: “So Frank, what would you most like to see finished in this next iteration?”
Line 1862: The team planned their second iteration in the same way that they’d planned
Line 1863: their first. When they finished, they had committed to completing the user
Line 1864: stories shown in Table 23.18.
Line 1865: “So if our velocity was sixteen in the last iteration, why are we planning for
Line 1866: eighteen this time?” Frank asked.
Line 1867: “We use velocity as a guide for measuring progress against the release plan,”
Line 1868: Carlos said. “We don’t automatically plan each new iteration to have exactly the
Line 1869: velocity of the last iteration or the average velocity of the last few iterations. We
Line 1870: plan each iteration based on how much work we can commit to. We add up the
Line 1871: points only after we’ve figured out what we can commit to. When we do, the ve-
Line 1872: locity should be somewhere close to our historical average, but it will vary.”
Line 1873: “Why?”
Line 1874: “Two primary reasons,” Sasha began. “First, we’re making more effective use
Line 1875: of Rose this time. She’s primarily an artist, not a tester. It was great that she
Line 1876: helped with so much testing last time, but this time, she’s going to draw the art
Line 1877: for the wooden and metal boards and pieces. I’ll do the coding to let a user
Line 1878: choose between them, and Prasad will probably be the one to test that story. But
Line 1879: other than that, most of that eight-point story comes from Rose. Second, we’ve
Line 1880: got a bit of a head start on the story about recognizing a winning shape. We
Line 1881: started it last iteration but didn’t get far. I feel pretty good about the stories we
Line 1882: selected. Even though it’s eighteen points again, it added up to fifteen total
Line 1883: hours less than the last iteration.”
Line 1884: “I’m convinced,” Frank said. “Let’s do it.”

Line 1903: At the next iteration review, the team again demonstrated good progress. They
Line 1904: had completed each of the stories they’d planned. And Delaney had time to com-
Line 1905: plete her product research. The executives, Phil and Laura, attended again. Be-
Line 1906: cause the news had spread about how much had been accomplished in their first
Line 1907: two weeks, even more people from other teams attended the second review.
Line 1908: “The game is coming together. I can’t believe your move engine can already
Line 1909: beat me,” Phil said. “And Rose, those first two boards look fantastic. Are we still
Line 1910: looking at the same schedule? That would be eight to sixteen weeks from now.”
Line 1911: “Our rate of progress is right about where we expected it to be,” Frank said.
Line 1912: “So we’re good there. Delaney did some more product research during this iter-
Line 1913: ation, and she’s found some interesting features we may need to include. I’ll
Line 1914: make the call on that, but I need to hear the team’s view first. I may suggest
Line 1915: changing the schedule. We’re confident the new features will bring in more
Line 1916: money. Now I need to weigh that against the extra development cost and the ex-
Line 1917: tra time.”
Line 1918: “I like the part about bringing in more revenue,” Laura, the chief financial
Line 1919: officer, said.
Line 1920: “Me, too,” Phil agreed. “But I’m not wild about a possible slip already.”
Line 1921: “It wouldn’t be a slip, Phil,” Frank said. “If you want to deliver the product in
Line 1922: the originally planned twelve to twenty weeks, we’re feeling pretty good about
Line 1923: that. What we’re going to discuss after this meeting is how much longer it would
Line 1924: take to create a more valuable game. And then we’ll see if there are features we
Line 1925: can drop that would get us that more valuable game in close to the same twenty
Line 1926: weeks we gave as our upper end.”
Line 1927: “I’m always interested in more valuable games. Let me know what you rec-
Line 1928: ommend,” Phil said as he stood and left the conference room. The rest of the
Line 1929: guests left as well, leaving only the project team.

Line 1931: “Frank has already told you that I found some new exciters,” Delaney said. “A
Line 1932: couple of you heard me talking on the phone with potential buyers about these.
Line 1933: The good news is that our target audience really wants two features we haven’t
Line 1934: thought about. First, they want the computer player to have different personali-
Line 1935: ties who each play the game differently. One character may be very aggressive;
Line 1936: another, conservative. A character that a lot of people asked for is one who taunts

Line 1939: 306 |
Line 1940: Chapter 23
Line 1941: A Case Study: Bomb Shelter Studios
Line 1942: them. It says mean things after a bad move, laughs at them when they
Line 1943: lose…stuff like that.”
Line 1944: “That does sound fun,” Allan said. “It’ll change the move engine, but proba-
Line 1945: bly not much. It’s already configurable to allow me to tune it for more aggressive
Line 1946: or more conservative play.”
Line 1947:  “That’s the first new feature,” Delaney continued. “The second is online
Line 1948: play. People want to play this game online against other humans.”
Line 1949: “That’s huge,” Sasha said. “We’d need to get space in a data center, acquire
Line 1950: the hardware, and hire the staff.”
Line 1951: “We could partner for all that,” Frank said. “It’s not out of the question, but
Line 1952: you’re right that’s it’s big. Delaney, do you have any sense of which feature is
Line 1953: more important?”
Line 1954: “The characters. Good characters would be a big exciter. That is a feature
Line 1955: that people really like but that they don’t expect,” Delaney said.
Line 1956: “Delaney, you just told us that we’ve got scope creep. And we were already at
Line 1957: the upper end of our twelve- to twenty-week estimate,” Prasad said. “Why did
Line 1958: you say you have ‘good news’? Do you have something else to tell us?”
Line 1959: “No, that’s it, Prasad,” Delaney said. “But this is good news. We just found
Line 1960: two new features that could help us sell more units, and at a higher price. Yeah,
Line 1961: if we do them, the schedule will change. But that’s a good problem to have. We
Line 1962: can ship the product based on today’s schedule and make a certain amount of
Line 1963: money. Or we can change the schedule and plan on making more money. Plans
Line 1964: are always point-in-time predictions. We just found a better future to aim at. I’ve
Line 1965: already written the user stories for both features. We should estimate them and
Line 1966: decide if we want to change the plan to include either or both.”
Line 1967: “Let’s do it,” said Frank. “I’m completely willing to change the date of the
Line 1968: project if we can make enough more money and it’s not a big delay. It sounds like
Line 1969: these features could be very lucrative.”
Line 1970: “But Delaney, why didn’t the questionnaire you sent out identify these fea-
Line 1971: tures?” Prasad said.
Line 1972: “Questionnaires are good for prioritizing what we already know,” Delaney
Line 1973: said. “They obviously aren’t good for discovering features we don’t know about.
Line 1974: Some of the questionnaires we got back did mention characters and online play,
Line 1975: but not enough that I thought there was a trend. I spent this past iteration talk-
Line 1976: ing to more likely buyers to confirm that these are good ideas and adjusting my
Line 1977: financial models to show how much more revenue these features are likely to
Line 1978: bring in.”

Line 1986: release.”
Line 1987: “I liked burgers to celebrate the release of Deep Black & White,” Prasad said.
Line 1988: “Not me. After this one, I say Frank springs for sushi,” Rose said.
Line 1989: The team estimated the new stories Delaney had written. In doing so, they
Line 1990: split some of her original stories and combined others. When they were done,
Line 1991: the stories for online play added to thirty story points. They estimated creating
Line 1992: the first character as fifteen story points. Each character after that would be five
Line 1993: additional points. The team discussed it and agreed that five characters would be
Line 1994: a reasonable number. This meant an additional thirty-five story points for devel-
Line 1995: oping the characters.
Line 1996: Because Delaney’s financial forecasts showed that characters were likely to
Line 1997: generate more revenue than online play, everyone agreed that they should adjust
Line 1998: their plan to include characters but not to include an online version. 
Line 1999: “In the first two iterations we finished sixteen and then eighteen points. We
Line 2000: just added thirty-five points. We’re going backward!” Allan joked.
Line 2001: “You’re right, Allan,” Carlos said as he reached for a calculator. “We’ve got
Line 2002: 133 points. With our current average velocity of 17 points per iteration, that’s
Line 2003: 7.8 more iterations.”
Line 2004: “Eight more iterations, plus the two we’ve already done, and we finish in ten
Line 2005: iterations,” Frank said.
Line 2006: “It’s cutting it awfully close, Frank,” Sasha said. “Yes, it seems like we’ll fin-
Line 2007: ish in ten iterations. It’s a good thing our original schedule was a range and that
Line 2008: we didn’t just tell people ‘eight iterations.’ However, if anything goes wrong—if
Line 2009: a story is bigger than we think, or if we slow down, or if someone gets sick—we
Line 2010: could take longer than eight more iterations.”
Line 2011: “Are you saying we should change the schedule?” Frank asked. 
Line 2012: “Not necessarily,” Carlos answered. “If we want to keep the schedule at ten
Line 2013: iterations, though, we should make sure we’re willing to drop some low-priority
Line 2014: stories if we start to run out of time. If you’re not willing to do that, we should
Line 2015: convey the expectation that it may take longer than ten iterations.”
Line 2016: “I can probably drop a few stories, if necessary,” Frank said. 
Line 2017: “Good. Remember how I told you it’s important to know the stories at the
Line 2018: top of your priority list and those at the bottom? This is a time when it’s impor-
Line 2019: tant to know those at the bottom. I’ll feel more comfortable keeping expectations
Line 2020: at no more than ten iterations if you can point out at least seventeen points of

Line 2024: Chapter 23
Line 2025: A Case Study: Bomb Shelter Studios
Line 2026: stories that you could live without if it meant going longer than ten iterations,”
Line 2027: Carlos said.
Line 2028: “Here are a couple I could live without: As a new player, I’d like to be warned
Line 2029: after making a horrible move and be given the chance to take it back and As a
Line 2030: new player, I want to be able to view an interactive tutorial for the game. Each
Line 2031: of those is eight points. I’ve already said I could live without the six points of
Line 2032: background-music stories.”
Line 2033: “So you should work on those last. If you start to run out of time by the
Line 2034: tenth iteration, drop one or more of those,” Carlos said.
Line 2035: “And if we’re on schedule and choose not to implement those stories, we
Line 2036: could release at least an iteration sooner, right? When would we release if we left
Line 2037: out those stories?” Frank asked.
Line 2038: “We’ve got 133 points planned. You’re willing to drop twenty-two points.
Line 2039: That gives us 111,” Carlos said as he reached for the calculator. “With a velocity
Line 2040: of seventeen, you need seven more iterations. You could be done in eighteen in-
Line 2041: stead of 20 weeks.”
Line 2042: “Let’s keep those stories in the plan for now. I’ll drop them if we need to, but
Line 2043: they’re probably worth two additional weeks,” Frank said. “I want to go run the
Line 2044: new plan by Phil, because he asked to hear what we decided. Does anyone want
Line 2045: to join me?”
Line 2046: Delaney and Allan both said they did. It wasn’t a surprise that Delaney did. As
Line 2047: the analyst, Delaney was often involved in product and schedule decisions. Frank
Line 2048: was surprised by Allan’s interest, though. Normally, Allan, one of the most hard-
Line 2049: core technical people in all of Bomb Shelter, wanted nothing to do with business
Line 2050: discussions. He’d really engaged in those discussions, though, since starting this
Line 2051: project four weeks ago. Frank appreciated that. It was leading to better product
Line 2052: decisions all around.
Line 2053: “I’m going up there now,” Frank said. “Let’s do it.”
Line 2054: “Shouldn’t we prepare anything for Phil first?” Allan asked.
Line 2055: “Nope. He’s got a whiteboard. We’ll just draw on that.”
Line 2056: Presenting the Revised Plan to Phil
Line 2057: “Hi, Phil. Do you still want to hear what we’ve decided about those new features
Line 2058: in Havannah?” Frank asked.
Line 2059: “Absolutely. These are the features Delaney mentioned this morning?”
Line 2060: “Yes.”

Line 2066: “I’ve got about fifteen minutes now. Will that work?”
Line 2067: “It should be plenty,” Frank said. He then asked Delaney to explain how her
Line 2068: research had led to the discovery of the new ideas for online play and characters. 
Line 2069: “Phil, do you remember a few weeks ago when I told you how we are esti-
Line 2070: mating in story points?”
Line 2071: “Sure.”
Line 2072: “And that story points are a measure of size. We started out with 132 story
Line 2073: points. In the first iteration, we finished sixteen. In the second, we finished eigh-
Line 2074: teen. Allan, can you draw that?” Frank asked, pointing to an empty space on
Line 2075: Phil’s whiteboard. Allan went to the whiteboard and drew Figure 23.5.
Line 2076: Figure 23.5 The Havannah release burndown after the first two iterations.
Line 2077: “What you see here,” Frank continued, “is what we call a release burndown
Line 2078: chart. From looking at it, you can see our rate of progress. After two iterations,
Line 2079: we’re down thirty-four points. If you extended a trend line from this data you’d
Line 2080: see that we are on pace to finish during the eighth iteration. That’s sixteen weeks
Line 2081: total.”
Line 2082: While Frank was speaking, Allan drew the trend line shown in Figure 23.6.
Line 2083: “The whole Havannah team thinks that adding the characters Delaney iden-
Line 2084: tified is a good idea.”
Line 2085: “How long will that take?” Phil asked.
Line 2086: “We think we need five characters. It’s a total of thirty-five points,” Frank
Line 2087: said.

Line 2165: move engine. I’ve only done the weak game engine, but I’m starting to see how
Line 2166: we’ll write the strong engine. We’ve also learned a lot. We learned about a new
Line 2167: feature that Delaney says is ‘exciting’ to our target audience. Normally, we’d find
Line 2168: that out much later. If I look at where we’re at, yes, we still have as much work to
Line 2169: do as we thought four weeks ago, but now I’m more confident in the plan than I
Line 2170: was four weeks ago. And every time we put a new data point on this burndown
Line 2171: chart, I get more confident, even if not every new point is good news. It will be
Line 2172: news I can trust about the progress we’re making.” Allan paused. “We’re much
Line 2173: better off than we were four weeks ago.”
Line 2174: “So how long will the project take if we add the characters?” Phil asked.
Line 2175: Frank was surprised, but pleasantly, that the question had been directed at Allan.
Line 2176: “Probably eight more iterations, or a total of twenty weeks. We’re complet-
Line 2177: ing seventeen points of work per iteration. We call that our velocity. If we draw a
Line 2178: trendline showing seventeen points of progress per iteration, we finish in eight
Line 2179: more iterations.” Allan drew the trend line shown in Figure 23.8. “That cuts it
Line 2180: pretty close, so we’ve identified a few low-priority pieces we could drop if we start
Line 2181: to get behind or if we decide to release after eighteen weeks instead of twenty.”

Line 2184: “And the game would sell more or be at a higher price?” Phil asked.
Line 2185: “Yes, I’m certain of that,” Frank said. “I want to do a bit more research and
Line 2186: modeling to determine if we should sell more copies at the current price or if we
Line 2187: should increase the price by $5.”

Line 2214: “Don’t. Leave it there,” Phil said. “I want to update that every two weeks.”
Line 2215: “Thanks for your time, Phil,” Frank said as he, Delaney, and Allan left the
Line 2216: office.
Line 2217: Eighteen Weeks Later
Line 2218: “Great job, team. The game looks wonderful,” Frank said at the end of the final
Line 2219: iteration review meeting. “I don’t see anything that’s missing. The engines play
Line 2220: very well. And Rose, I love the characters. The way that each character is tied to
Line 2221: an engine is great. Players will select a character to play against rather than a
Line 2222: level to play at. I admit I was skeptical of cartoonish characters rather than real
Line 2223: characters at first, but they’re great. I like how the pirate taunts the player and
Line 2224: how you hooked a friendly mermaid to the easy move engine. Her dialogue is
Line 2225: definitely going to help new players learn the game. I think we’re ready to ship.”
Line 2226: “I admit the game is great, but I still don’t like the feeling that we’re late. We
Line 2227: originally thought we’d be done in just over fourteen weeks. But we told every-
Line 2228: one twelve to twenty. Now we’ve slipped two weeks past that,” Prasad said.
Line 2229: “Yes, and here we are done in twenty-two weeks,” Sasha said. “We never said
Line 2230: we’d be done in fourteen weeks. After the first iteration planning planning, we
Line 2231: told everyone twelve to twenty weeks and that a more accurate estimate would
Line 2232: come after six weeks.”
Line 2233: “And Prasad, keep in mind that we could have shipped two weeks ago if we’d
Line 2234: wanted,” Frank said. “We chose to take time to incorporate additional changes
Line 2235: into the characters based on the positive responses we were getting from beta
Line 2236: testers. They loved the characters but gave us some great suggestions we wanted
Line 2237: to incorporate. We made the pirate taunt a little more often, based on their feed-
Line 2238: back. And we gave the rap singer more dialogue. Sure, the initial schedule was
Line 2239: wrong, but so was the product design. That game wouldn’t have made us any-
Line 2240: where near the return that this one will. You’ve played the new version. You
Line 2241: know how much better it is now, only two weeks off our initial high-end esti-
Line 2242: mate. If we could have released a version 1.0 without characters and then added
Line 2243: characters later, I would have done that. But we can’t do that in our industry. I’m
Line 2244: ecstatic with the product. It’s more than we expected and only two weeks later
Line 2245: than an estimate given at the start of the project.”
Line 2246: “And don’t forget Deep Black & White was six months late, not two weeks.”
Line 2247: “So Frank, are you buying us burgers again to celebrate this release?” 
Line 2248: “No, this time I’m buying whatever you want.”

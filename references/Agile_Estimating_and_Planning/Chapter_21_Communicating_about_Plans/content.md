Line 6: “The more elaborate our means of communication,
Line 7: the less we communicate.”
Line 8: —Joseph Priestley
Line 9: In this chapter, we will look at some specific ways to communicate about plans.
Line 10: However, more important than specifically what we communicate is how we ap-
Line 11: proach the work of communicating about estimates and plans. We want all com-
Line 12: munication, but especially communication about estimates and plans, to be
Line 13: frequent, honest, and two-way.
Line 14: Frequent communication about plans is important because of how often an
Line 15: agile plan is updated. For example, even if a team does rolling lookahead plan-
Line 16: ning (as described in Chapter 18, “Planning the Multiple-Team Project”), their
Line 17: release plan may show only what will be developed in the next few iterations. The
Line 18: user stories that will be developed through the rest of the release may be in-
Line 19: cluded in the release plan, but they will not be sequenced beyond the horizon of
Line 20: the lookahead plan and may be listed only as broad themes. 
Line 21: We cannot (and do not want to) produce a plan on the first day and leave it
Line 22: alone for three to six months. Plans are updated throughout the project, and
Line 23: these updates need to be communicated. Failing to do so ignores the valuable
Line 24: feedback loops that can improve the desirability and success of the product and
Line 25: the usefulness of the plan. During the short timebox of an iteration, it is impor-
Line 26: tant for team members to see daily variations in the iteration burndown chart so
Line 27: that they can make adjustments to complete all the work of the iteration. Over

Line 32: Communicating about Plans
Line 33: the longer period of a release, project stakeholders and participants need insight
Line 34: into progress against and revisions to the release plan. 
Line 35: Honest communication is important if the development team and customer
Line 36: team are to trust each other. If the developers learn, for example, that the prod-
Line 37: uct owner has been telling them artificial dates, they will no longer trust her.
Line 38: Similarly, if developers give estimates that the product owner knows are unreal-
Line 39: istic, trust will disappear here as well. I worked with a team recently that told me
Line 40: their executives ask for more work than can reasonably be expected because
Line 41: “That way, if they get 80%, they’re happy.” The theory was that the executives
Line 42: would get 80% of whatever they asked for, so they knew to ask for more than
Line 43: needed.
Line 44: Without trust, it is hard to have honest communication, so the loss of trust
Line 45: must be taken very seriously. If a developer knows that a given task will take
Line 46: much longer than currently expected, she needs to feel safe sharing that knowl-
Line 47: edge with the rest of the team, including her manager. If this type of honest
Line 48: communication is discouraged, problems such as this will remain hidden longer.
Line 49: It is important that communication about estimating and planning be two-
Line 50: way, because we want to encourage dialogue and discussion about the plan so
Line 51: that we make sure we always have the best possible plan (given current knowl-
Line 52: edge) for delivering value to the organization. We want to iterate and refine
Line 53: plans based on feedback and new knowledge. Because of this, we need dialogue
Line 54: about plans, not one-way presentations. 
Line 55: Finally, make it your responsibility to make sure that all recipients under-
Line 56: stand the message you are delivering. They need not only to hear the message,
Line 57: but also to understand it. If you are a project manager delivering the message
Line 58: that the project is behind schedule, do it in such a manner that no one can fail to
Line 59: understand. This is one of the reasons that agile teams favor big, visible charts as
Line 60: a way of communicating—with no more than a handful of big, visible charts
Line 61: hanging in the team’s workspace, it is likely that everyone on the project team
Line 62: will understand the significance of each. To the contrary, if the news that a
Line 63: project is behind is “clearly” shown on page thirty-two of a forty-page weekly sta-
Line 64: tus report, it’s quite likely that no one knows it. 
Line 65: With these goals in mind, the rest of this chapter provides some specific
Line 66: guidance and tips on how to communicate about estimates and plans.

Line 71: 237
Line 72: Communicating the Plan
Line 73: When asked about the schedule for a project, it is tempting to sum the number
Line 74: of story points to be delivered, divide by a guess of velocity, and say something
Line 75: like “We’ll ship on June 14, which is 7.2 iterations from now.” This is wrong be-
Line 76: cause it gives the impression that the knowledge from which we construct the
Line 77: plan is sufficiently precise as to support this type of estimate. When possible, in-
Line 78: clude with your communication of a target date either your degree of confidence
Line 79: in the estimate, a range of possible dates, or both. For example, you may say:
Line 80: ◆I am 90% sure we’ll complete the planned functionality by July 31.
Line 81: ◆Based on our assumptions about the project size and team performance, the
Line 82: project will take three to four months.
Line 83: As an example of this type of communication, Ron Jeffries (2004) of
Line 84: www.XProgramming.com has suggested saying something like this:
Line 85: Right now, this appears to be a 200-point project. Based on our performance on 
Line 86: other projects (or a random guess), with N programmers on it, and your inti-
Line 87: mate involvement in the project, a project of this size will take between four and 
Line 88: six months. However, we will be shipping software to you every two weeks, and 
Line 89: we’ll be ticking off these feature stories to your satisfaction. The good news is 
Line 90: that if you’re not satisfied, you can stop. The better news is that if you become 
Line 91: satisfied before all the features are done, you can stop. The bad news is that you 
Line 92: need to work with us to make it clear just what your satisfaction means. The best 
Line 93: news is that whenever there are enough features working to make the program 
Line 94: useful, you can ask us to prepare it for deployment, and we’ll do that. As we go 
Line 95: forward, we’ll all see how fast we’re progressing, and our estimate of the time 
Line 96: needed will improve. In every case, you’ll see what is going on, you’ll see con-
Line 97: crete evidence of useful software running the tests that you specify, and you’ll 
Line 98: know everything as soon as I know it.
Line 99: Some companies have become accustomed to communicating project
Line 100: schedules through the familiar Gantt chart, as shown in Figure 21.1. Gantt
Line 101: charts have earned a bad reputation, but this is because of how they are often
Line 102: used to predict, schedule, and coordinate tasks. Despite these challenges in their
Line 103: use, Gantt charts can be great tools for showing the allocation of features to iter-
Line 104: ations.
Line 105: There are a couple of minor but key differences between what is shown in
Line 106: Figure 21.1 and a more traditional Gantt chart. First, Figure 21.1 stops at the
Line 107: feature level and does not decompose each user story into its constituent tasks.
Line 108: What is shown then is a feature breakdown structure rather than a work
Line 109: 
Line 110: --- 페이지 269 ---
Line 111: 238 |
Line 112: Chapter 21
Line 113: Communicating about Plans
Line 114: breakdown structure of the project. Because it is the completion of features,
Line 115: rather than the completion of the tasks that add up to a feature, that adds value
Line 116: to a product, the Gantt chart is drawn showing features. 
Line 117: Second, each feature is shown to take the full length of the iteration into
Line 118: which it is scheduled. A feature may be done midway through an iteration, but it
Line 119: is not made available to the organization until the end of the iteration, so that is
Line 120: what the Gantt chart reflects.
Line 121: Figure 21.1 Showing iteration contents in a Gantt chart.
Line 122: Third, no resource allocations are shown in Figure 21.1. Because the whole
Line 123: team is responsible for the delivery of all features, there is no benefit in putting
Line 124: Mary’s name next to one feature and Vadim’s next to another. Of course, if you’re
Line 125: producing a Gantt chart showing the work of multiple teams, you may want to
Line 126: indicate whole-team responsibility by assigning features (or really entire itera-
Line 127: tions) to Team 1 or Team 2, and so on.
Line 128: Communicating Progress
Line 129: Naturally, the release burndown charts of Chapter 19, “Monitoring the Release
Line 130: Plan,” are a primary way of communicating progress. Progress on a release
Line 131: burndown chart is a function of the amount of work remaining and the velocity
Line 132: of the team. The simple way to predict the number of iterations remaining is to
Line 133: take the number of points remaining to be developed, divide this by the team’s

Line 180: velocity, and then round up to next whole number. So if there are 100 points re-
Line 181: maining and the team’s velocity is 10, we could say there are 10 iterations re-
Line 182: maining. 
Line 183: However, measures of velocity are imprecise, and we expect velocity to fluc-
Line 184: tuate. If a team has determined their average velocity is ten, it is not inconceiv-
Line 185: able that it averages nine or eleven for the next few iterations. In fact, it’s not
Line 186: inconceivable for velocity to be seven or thirteen over the next few iterations. In
Line 187: those cases, there could be as few as eight or as many as fifteen iterations left.
Line 188: When forecasting the number of iterations remaining, it generally is best to use
Line 189: a range of probable velocities.
Line 190: To see one way of selecting the range of velocities, consider Figure 21.2,
Line 191: which shows a team’s velocity over their preceding eight iterations. Velocity in
Line 192: the most recent iteration was nineteen. However, the average velocity over the
Line 193: past eight iterations is seventeen, and the average of this team’s worst three iter-
Line 194: ations is fourteen. Each of these values will lead to a different expectation about
Line 195: when all of the currently planned work will be complete. This is why it is often
Line 196: best to use more than one velocity value and to present conclusions as a range of
Line 197: likely outcomes.
Line 198: Figure 21.2 Velocity as measured for the last eight iterations.
Line 199: In selecting a range of velocity values, I typically consider up to the last eight
Line 200: iterations. Many teams stay together that long, but going back beyond eight

Line 221: Communicating about Plans
Line 222: iterations starts to feel like ancient history to me. If you don’t have eight itera-
Line 223: tions, use what you have. From these previous iterations, I look at three values.
Line 224: 1. The velocity of the most recent iteration
Line 225: 2. The average (mean) velocity
Line 226: 3. The average (mean) velocity of the three slowest iterations
Line 227: These three values present a good picture of what just happened, a “long
Line 228: term” average, and a worst-case of what could happen. I use these three different
Line 229: velocity values to forecast approximately how much more work may be com-
Line 230: pleted by a given date. For example, if we would like to release the product after
Line 231: five more iterations, and the team’s most recent velocity was 19, we can predict
Line 232: that the team might complete another 95 points. Similar math can be done with
Line 233: the other measures of velocity. Doing so results in a range of the likely amount
Line 234: of work the team will complete. I usually summarize this as shown in Table 21.1.
Line 235: Although I look for trends in velocity, many projects have too few iterations
Line 236: for velocity trends to become either apparent or relevant. If I notice what appears
Line 237: to be a trend toward an increasing velocity, I am pleased but don’t act on it. I
Line 238: would never draw a trend line through Figure 21.2, for example, and predict that
Line 239: the team’s velocity will be twenty in the next iteration. Similarly, if velocity ap-
Line 240: peared to be headed downward, I would figure out and remove the cause of the
Line 241: decline rather than plan on velocity continuing to drop.
Line 242: Calculating the three expected velocity values (as shown in Table 21.1) al-
Line 243: lows the product owner and team to make predictions about the amount of work
Line 244: that can be completed before a planned release date. Based on Table 21.1, for ex-
Line 245: ample, a product owner should feel comfortable that at least seventy additional
Line 246: story points will be added during the next five iterations. However, the product
Line 247: owner probably should not take out advertising space on a blimp about anything
Line 248: beyond eighty-five more story points.

Line 271: An End-of-Iteration Summary
Line 272: Yes, it may not seem agile to suggest writing an end-of-iteration summary re-
Line 273: port. But almost every manager I talk to asks me if I do so. After I answer in the
Line 274: affirmative, I am almost always asked to share the template I use. You’ll have to
Line 275: decide for yourself whether you want to take the time to do this. I find that I can
Line 276: complete this summary document in less than thirty minutes per iteration. I
Line 277: tend to favor two-week iterations on most projects, so this means I invest at
Line 278: most fifteen minutes per week in this.

Line 393: Summary
Line 394: We want communication about estimates and plans to be frequent, honest, and
Line 395: two-way. A Gantt chart can be a useful tool for communicating about a plan.
Line 396: However, it should not be taken below the feature breakdown level, and features
Line 397: on it should be shown as in process for the entire duration of the iteration.
Line 398: Burndown charts are the primary method for communicating about
Line 399: progress, but they are often accompanied by a chart showing the development
Line 400: team’s velocity per iteration. It is to useful to think of velocity as a range of val-
Line 401: ues rather than one value. A good way to do this is to use the velocity of the most

Line 457: 16, and 14. You are asked when the project will be done. What do you say?

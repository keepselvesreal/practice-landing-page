Line 7: —Clint Eastwood in Heartbreak Ridge
Line 8: Release planning is the process of creating a very high-level plan that covers a
Line 9: period longer than an iteration. A typical release will cover perhaps three to six
Line 10: months and maybe three to twelve or more iterations, depending on how long
Line 11: the iterations are. A release plan is important for a number of reasons.
Line 12: First, it helps the product owner and the whole team decide how much must
Line 13: be developed and how long that will take before they have a releasable product.
Line 14: The sooner the product can be released (and the better it is when it’s released),
Line 15: the sooner the organization will begin earning a return on its investment in the
Line 16: project.
Line 17: Second, a release plan conveys expectations about what is likely to be devel-
Line 18: oped and in what timeframe. Many organizations need this information because
Line 19: it feeds into other strategic planning activities. 
Line 20: Third, a release plan serves as a guidepost toward which the project team
Line 21: can progress. Without the concept of a release, teams move endlessly from one
Line 22: iteration to the next. A release plan provides context that allows iterations to
Line 23: combine into a satisfying whole. This is a fundamental concern with any itera-
Line 24: tive process, not just agile ones. A hiker who wishes to reach the summit of a
Line 25: mountain may head for the highest peak he sees. However, once he reaches that
Line 26: summit he learns that it was a false peak. A higher summit had been obscured by
Line 27: the one he has reached. The hiker sets off toward the higher summit, only to find
Line 28: 
Line 29: --- 페이지 165 ---
Line 30: 134 |
Line 31: Chapter 13
Line 32: Release Planning Essentials
Line 33: that it, too, is a false peak, and an even higher summit is now visible. This rather
Line 34: circuituous way of hiking up a mountain can apply equally to iterative projects.
Line 35: Fortunately, the problems it creates are eliminated by having a release plan that
Line 36: shows a team’s current expectation of where they ultimately wish to arrive.
Line 37: The Release Plan
Line 38: Part of planning a release is determining how much can be accomplished by
Line 39: what date. In some cases, we start with a date and see how much can be finished
Line 40: by then. In other cases, we start with a set of user stories and see how long it will
Line 41: take to develop them. In both cases, once a team has an initial answer, it is as-
Line 42: sessed against the organization’s goals for the project: Will the product devel-
Line 43: oped make the desired amount of money? Will it save enough money? Will the
Line 44: product capture the target market share? If not, perhaps a longer or shorter
Line 45: project may achieve an acceptable set of goals. 
Line 46: At a cursory level, determining how much work will fit into a release and
Line 47: what user stories that will be is a very straightforward process. Multiplying the
Line 48: planned number of iterations by either the expected or known velocity of the
Line 49: team gives us the total amount of work that can be performed. We then select
Line 50: the number of user stories that will fit and are done. Suppose that we wish to
Line 51: ship a new product in six months. We plan to work in two-week iterations, so
Line 52: there will be thirteen iterations during the project. We expect the team’s velocity
Line 53: to be twenty story points or ideal days per iterations. The size of the total project
Line 54: is then 
Line 55:  story points or ideal days. The product owner and team
Line 56: could then discuss all of the stories and prioritize them to deliver the most value
Line 57: possible while paying attention to not going above 260. The release plan itself is
Line 58: usually documented as simply a list of the user stories that will be developed dur-
Line 59: ing the project.
Line 60: During release planning, we do not want to create a plan that indicates
Line 61: which developers will work on which user stories or tasks, or the sequence in
Line 62: which work will be performed within an iteration. Creating a plan with that level
Line 63: of detail during release planning is dangerous and misleading. Decisions about
Line 64: who works on what and the sequence of activities are best left to the individuals
Line 65: working on those tasks and are best deferred as long as possible. Additionally, re-
Line 66: member that items in a release plan are user stories, which are descriptions of
Line 67: the functionality to be delivered, not individual engineering tasks to be per-
Line 68: formed. During release planning, it is too early, and some user stories may be in-
Line 69: sufficiently understood to be disaggregated into engineering tasks. As you’ll see
Line 70: in Chapter 14, “Iteration Planning,” the team will eventually disaggregate the

Line 79: |
Line 80: 135
Line 81: user stories of the release plan into their constituent tasks. But they won’t do
Line 82: this until the beginning of the iteration containing those stories.
Line 83: Naturally, should your project, organization, and work environment warrant
Line 84: it, you can include additional information in a release plan. For example, you
Line 85: may wish to communicate some key assumptions underlying the plan. Most no-
Line 86: tably, you may want to state assumptions about who is on the team, how long the
Line 87: iterations will be, the date the first iteration will start, and the date the last iter-
Line 88: ation will finish. Chapter 21, “Communicating about Plans,” will describe some
Line 89: additional useful information you may want to include when communicating
Line 90: about a release plan. 
Line 91: The general steps in planning a release are shown in Figure 13.1. Each of
Line 92: these steps will be described in the sections that follow.
Line 93: Figure 13.1 The steps in planning a release.
Line 94: Determine the Conditions of Satisfaction
Line 95: Before starting to plan a release, it is important to know the criteria by which the
Line 96: project will be evaluated as a success or a failure. For most projects, the ultimate
Line 97: scorecard is the amount of money saved or generated. As leading indicators of
Line 98: whether a project is likely to achieve these financial goals, most projects use the
Line 99: triumvirate of schedule, scope, and resources. For most projects, this means that
Line 100: the product owner’s conditions of satisfaction are defined by a combination of
Line 101: schedule, scope, and resource goals. 
Line 102: The product owner will bring desired targets for each of these factors into al-
Line 103: most every release planning meeting. A product owner may want four themes
Line 104: Iterate until the conditions
Line 105: of satisfaction for the

Line 129: (worth 200 story points) developed in three months without adding personnel,
Line 130: for example. Although a target for each factor is often identified, one factor is
Line 131: usually preeminent. Projects are typically either date-driven or feature-driven. A
Line 132: date-driven project is one that must be released by a certain date but for which
Line 133: the feature set is negotiable. A feature-driven project is one that we would prob-
Line 134: ably like to release as soon as possible but for which we consider the completion
Line 135: of a set of features to be more important.
Line 136: Estimate the User Stories
Line 137: Because an estimate represents the cost of developing a user story, it is impor-
Line 138: tant that each has been estimated. Imagine that you’ve decided to replace every
Line 139: item of clothing in your closet. You arrive at the mall and start shopping. How-
Line 140: ever, you notice that all the price tags have been removed and that you have no
Line 141: way of knowing the cost of anything. This is what it feels like to be a product
Line 142: owner who is not provided any estimates. 
Line 143: It is not necessary to estimate everything that a product owner may ever
Line 144: want. It is necessary only to have an estimate for each new feature that has some
Line 145: reasonable possibility of being selected for inclusion in the upcoming release.
Line 146: Often, a product owner will have a wish list that extends two, three, or more re-
Line 147: leases into the future. It is not necessary to have estimates on the more distant
Line 148: work. 
Line 149: Select an Iteration Length
Line 150: Most agile teams work in iterations of two to four weeks. It’s possible to go
Line 151: slightly longer, and some teams have experimented with even shorter iterations.
Line 152: When planning a release, an appropriate iteration length will need to be chosen.
Line 153: Guidance on doing this is provided in Chapter 15, “Selecting an Iteration
Line 154: Length.”
Line 155: Estimate Velocity
Line 156: If the team has experience working together, your best bet is often to use the ve-
Line 157: locity the team exhibited most recently. Naturally, if the technology or business
Line 158: domain has changed dramatically, it may not be appropriate to use a team’s past
Line 159: velocity. Still, there are techniques you can apply that enable you to make an in-
Line 160: formed estimate of velocity based on past results. In Chapter 16, “Estimating Ve-
Line 161: locity,” we will look at such techniques and will also explore options for
Line 162: estimating velocity.

Line 165: Select Stories and a Release Date 
Line 166: |
Line 167: 137
Line 168: Prioritize User Stories
Line 169: Most projects have either too little time or too many features. It is often impos-
Line 170: sible to do everything that everyone wants in the time allowed. Because of this,
Line 171: the product owner must prioritize the features she wants developed. A good
Line 172: product owner will accept ultimate responsibility for prioritizing but will listen
Line 173: to advice from the development team, especially about sequencing. User stories
Line 174: are prioritized based on the guidelines given in the previous part of this book.
Line 175: Select Stories and a Release Date
Line 176: At this point, you have an estimate of the team’s velocity per iteration and have
Line 177: an assumption about how many iterations there will be. It’s time to see whether
Line 178: a release can be planned that meets the conditions of satisfaction for the project. 
Line 179: If the project is feature-driven, we can sum the estimates of all needed fea-
Line 180: tures and divide by the expected velocity. This will give us the number of itera-
Line 181: tions necessary to complete the desired functionality.
Line 182: If the project is date-driven, we can determine the number of iterations by
Line 183: looking at a calendar. Multiplying the number of iterations by the expected ve-
Line 184: locity will tell us how many story points or ideal days will fit in the release. We
Line 185: can count off that many points or ideal days into the prioritized list of user
Line 186: stories and see how much functionality can be delivered in the desired time.
Line 187: The next question to be addressed regards how detailed the release plan will
Line 188: be. Some teams in some environments prefer to create a release plan that shows
Line 189: what they expect to develop during each iteration. Other teams prefer simply to
Line 190: determine what they think will be developed during the overall release, leaving
Line 191: the specifics of each iteration for later. This is something for the team to discuss
Line 192: and decide during release planning. 
Line 193: There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. Obviously, assign-
Line 194: ing specific features to specific iterations takes more time. However, the addi-
Line 195: tional detail this provides can be useful when coordinating work among multiple
Line 196: teams. On the other hand, not allocating work to specific iterations provides less
Line 197: detail, but it takes much less time. Further, even if we do preliminarily assign
Line 198: work to specific iterations, we do so with less knowledge than we’ll have at the
Line 199: start of each iteration. Undoubtedly, the plan will change as we learn more
Line 200: throughout the project. So the investment of time and effort to assign work to
Line 201: specific iterations should be weighed against this. Still, on some projects it may
Line 202: be worth doing. What I find to be a good compromise is to place specific work
Line 203: into the first one to three iterations, treating the rest of the release plan as one
Line 204: 
Line 205: --- 페이지 169 ---
Line 206: 138 |
Line 207: Chapter 13
Line 208: Release Planning Essentials
Line 209: large bucket. It’s almost always worth allocating specific work to the first itera-
Line 210: tion, especially if it is starting immediately.
Line 211: Because there are a lot of give-and-take and what-if questions during a typi-
Line 212: cal release planning session, we want an easy way to manipulate what’s in and
Line 213: out of the release and its iterations. The best way of achieving this, assuming ev-
Line 214: eryone is collocated, is to work with 3" x 5" note cards or sticky pads with user
Line 215: stories or features written on them. Unlike software, cards are tangible and easily
Line 216: shared. 
Line 217: To plan a release, the product owner selects her top priority items that will
Line 218: fit in the first iteration. Cards are stacked or arranged to indicate which stories
Line 219: comprise each iteration. Figure 13.2 shows one way of doing this. Cards can be
Line 220: arranged like this on a table or a wall. If you’re using a wall, a corkboard is very
Line 221: effective, because cards can be pinned to the board rather than taped to the wall.
Line 222: Because each story card is annotated with an estimate, it is possible to look down
Line 223: each column of an arrangement like Figure 13.2 and verify that each iteration
Line 224: holds the right amount of work.
Line 225: Figure 13.2 Arranging iterations in columns.
Line 226: Updating the Release Plan
Line 227: At this point, the release plan is done. However, it’s important that the release
Line 228: plan isn’t filed away somewhere or put up on a shelf, never to be touched again.

Line 273: The release plan should be revisited and updated with some regular frequency. If
Line 274: the development team’s velocity has remained fairly constant, and iteration
Line 275: planning hasn’t introduced any big surprises, you may want to go as long as four
Line 276: to six weeks without formally updating the release plan. On the other hand,
Line 277: many projects benefit from establishing a rule that the release plan will be revis-
Line 278: ited after each iteration.
Line 279: An Example
Line 280: To tie all of the preceding together, let’s consider a very brief example. We will
Line 281: again use the SwimStats website. Through market research we’ve discovered
Line 282: that coaches and swimmers in our target audience want the features described
Line 283: by the following user stories:
Line 284: ◆As a coach, I can define practice sessions.
Line 285: ◆As a coach, I can define custom fields I want to track for each swimmer.
Line 286: ◆As a swimmer, I can run a report that shows my improvement in all events
Line 287: since a date in the past.
Line 288: ◆As a swimmer, I can update my demographic information.
Line 289: ◆As a coach, I can send an email to all swimmers on the team.
Line 290: ◆As a system administrator, I can configure permissions and user groups.
Line 291: ◆As a coach, I can purchase SwimStats and use it for my team.
Line 292: ◆As a swimmer, I can compare my times with national records.
Line 293: ◆As a coach, I can enter enter the names and demographic information of all
Line 294: swimmers on my team.
Line 295: ◆As a swimmer, I can see my best times in each event.
Line 296: ◆As a user, I am required to log in and can see only data for which I have per-
Line 297: mission.
Line 298: ◆As a swimmer, I can see all of my times for a specific event.
Line 299: Determining the Conditions of Satisfaction
Line 300: The spring swim season starts in four months. The first release of the SwimStats
Line 301: website needs to be available a month before that. The product owner would like
Line 302: as many features as possible, but this is a date-driven project. Something must
Line 303: be releasable in three months, even if it is only the basics for small swim teams.

Line 358: orities. Based on points that will be presented in Chapter 15, “Selecting an Itera-
Line 359: tion Length,” everyone agrees to run two-week iterations.
Line 360: Estimating Velocity
Line 361: This project will be worked on by two programmers and a tester. Using the tech-
Line 362: niques you’ll learn in Chapter 16, “Estimating Velocity,” they forecast a velocity
Line 363: of eight story points per iteration.
Line 364: Prioritizing the User Stories
Line 365: The product owner, based on market research that has been done, prioritizes the
Line 366: stories. The prioritized story list, along with the estimate for each story is shown
Line 367: in Table 13.1.
Line 368: Selecting the User Stories
Line 369: Because this is a date-driven project, we know how many iterations there can be.
Line 370: The product owner wants a release out in three months so there is time for six
Line 371: two-week iterations followed by an extra week in case it’s needed. With an esti-
Line 372: mated velocity of eight points per iteration, this means the release will be
Line 373: planned to include 
Line 374:  story points. The product owner will be able to
Line 375: select up to forty-eight points from Table 13.1 to include in the release.
Line 376: The user stories in Table 13.1 have been sorted by the product owner in de-
Line 377: scending order of how valuable she thinks each will be to the initial release of
Line 378: SwimStats. The product owner is allowed to select up to forty-eight points. She
Line 379: initially indicates that she’d like to select the first eight stories, through “As a
Line 380: swimmer, I can compare my times with national records.” This is a total of forty-
Line 381: six points, which is close enough to forty-eight that the product owner agrees to
Line 382: stop there.
Line 383: However, the developers point out that the story prioritized as the lowest by
Line 384: the product owner is necessary: “As a system administrator, I can configure per-
Line 385: missions and user groups.” This story is estimated at three points, which would
Line 386: put the release at forty-nine and over the planned forty-eight. The forty-eight
Line 387: points is a fairly rough guess, and an extra week is planned after the sixth itera-
Line 388: tion. Some teams may allow for forty-nine points under these circumstances. 
Line 389: The SwimStats team, however, decides not to allow forty-nine points. If a
Line 390: three-point story is being added, at least one point needs to be dropped from the
Line 391: release. The product owner decides to drop the eight-point “As a swimmer, I can

Line 402: compare my times with national records.” This brings the release down to forty-
Line 403: one points. The product owner could add the three-point story, “As a coach, I can
Line 404: send an email to all swimmers on the team” to the release, but she decides to
Line 405: hold off on doing so. If the team gets even one point ahead of schedule, she’d pre-
Line 406: fer to add back the eight-point story she dropped. This makes the final release
Line 407: plan as shown in Table 13.2. 
Line 408: Summary
Line 409: A release plan is a high-level plan that covers a period longer than an iteration.
Line 410: For most teams a release occurs every three to six months, but it is not unusual
Line 411: to have releases more or less frequently, depending on the type of software. At its
Line 412: simplest level, release planning is trivial: Multiply the expected velocity by the
Line 413: number of planned iterations and then select stories whose estimates sum to fill
Line 414: up the release.
Line 415: A release plan does not have to describe exactly what will be worked on dur-
Line 416: ing each iteration. In fact, that level of detail is rarely needed. For most projects
Line 417: it is quite adequate to identify the stories that will be worked on in the first cou-
Line 418: ple of iterations, leaving the remaining stories to be prioritized into specific iter-
Line 419: ations later.

Line 5: An Agile Approach
Line 6: “A good plan violently executed now is better
Line 7: than a perfect plan executed next week.”
Line 8: —General George S. Patton
Line 9: Although it started years before, the agile movement officially began with the
Line 10: creation of the Agile Manifesto in February 2001 (Beck et al.). This manifesto
Line 11: was written and signed by seventeen “lightweight methodologists,” as they were
Line 12: called at the time. Their document both gave a name to how they were develop-
Line 13: ing software and provided a list of value statements. The authors of the Agile
Line 14: Manifesto wrote that they value
Line 15: ◆Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Line 16: ◆Working software over comprehensive documentation
Line 17: ◆Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Line 18: ◆Responding to change over following a plan
Line 19: Agile teams value individuals and interactions over processes and tools be-
Line 20: cause they know that a well-functioning team of great individuals with mediocre
Line 21: tools will always outperform a dysfunctional team of mediocre individuals with
Line 22: great tools and processes. Great software is made by great individuals, and as an
Line 23: industry we have tried too long with too little success to define a development
Line 24: process that relegates individuals to replaceable cogs in the machinery. Agile

Line 29: Chapter 3
Line 30: An Agile Approach
Line 31: processes acknowledge the unique strengths (and weaknesses) of individuals and
Line 32: capitalize on these rather than attempting to make everyone homogeneous. 
Line 33: Agile teams value working software over comprehensive documentation be-
Line 34: cause it leads them to have a stable, incrementally enhanced version of the prod-
Line 35: uct at the end of each iteration. This makes it possible to collect early, frequent
Line 36: feedback on both the product and the process. As the developed software grows
Line 37: each iteration, it can be shown to likely or actual users. Feedback from these us-
Line 38: ers is fed back into the development process to make sure that the team is always
Line 39: working on the highest-valued features and that those features will satisfy user
Line 40: expectations.
Line 41: Customer collaboration is valued over contract negotiation because agile
Line 42: teams would like all parties to the project to be working toward the same set of
Line 43: goals. Contract negotiation sometimes sets the development team and the
Line 44: project customer at odds right from the start. I enjoy playing most games, and
Line 45: when my oldest daughter was four, I bought her a “cooperative game” because it
Line 46: looked like a game she’d enjoy and because I had no idea how a cooperative game
Line 47: could be fun. In the game I bought her, a princess is placed under a spell, and
Line 48: players need to remove obstacles (a moat, a locked door, and so on) that are be-
Line 49: tween them and the princess. Players take turns, as in most games, but the goal
Line 50: is to remove obstacles collaboratively and save the princess. All players win, or
Line 51: all players lose. The game is surprisingly fun, and we’d like software teams and
Line 52: customers to approach projects with this same attitude of collaboration and
Line 53: shared goals. Yes, contracts are often necessary but the terms and details in a
Line 54: contract can exert great influence on whether the different parties are set on a
Line 55: collaborative or a competitive effort.
Line 56: Agile teams value responding to change over following a plan because their
Line 57: ultimate focus is on delivering as much value as possible to the project’s cus-
Line 58: tomer and users. For all but the simplest projects, it is impossible for users to
Line 59: know every detail of every feature they want. It is inevitable that users will come
Line 60: up with new ideas, and almost as inevitable that they will decide that some fea-
Line 61: tures desired today will become lower priorities tomorrow. To an agile team, a
Line 62: plan is one view of the future, but many views are possible. As a team gains
Line 63: knowledge and experience, they will factor these into the plan. Perhaps the team
Line 64: is progressing faster or slower than initially expected; perhaps users like one set
Line 65: of features more than expected but don’t like another feature that was initially
Line 66: considered critical. 
Line 67: With the four value statements of the Agile Manifesto in mind, in this chap-
Line 68: ter we consider what it means to have an agile approach to a project, as well as
Line 69: what it means to have an agile approach to estimating and planning.

Line 75: An Agile Approach to Projects
Line 76: With an understanding of the four primary agile value statements, we can turn
Line 77: our attention to what an agile team looks like in practice. Taken collectively, the
Line 78: four value statements lead to software development processes that are highly it-
Line 79: erative and incremental and that deliver coded and tested software at the end of
Line 80: each iteration. The following sections cover some of the main ways in which ag-
Line 81: ile teams work, including that they:
Line 82: ◆Work as one team
Line 83: ◆Work in short iterations
Line 84: ◆Deliver something each iteration
Line 85: ◆Focus on business priorities
Line 86: ◆Inspect and adapt
Line 87: An Agile Team Works As One
Line 88: Critical to the success of a project is that all project participants view themselves
Line 89: as one team aimed at a common goal. There is no room for a “throw it over the
Line 90: wall” mentality on an agile project. Analysts do not throw requirements over the
Line 91: wall to designers. Designers and architects do not throw designs over a wall to
Line 92: coders; coders do not throw half-tested code over a wall to testers. A successful
Line 93: agile team must have a we’re-all-in-this-together mindset. Although an agile
Line 94: team should work together as one whole team, there are a number of specific
Line 95: roles on the team. It is worth identifying and clarifying those roles that play a
Line 96: part in agile estimating and planning. 
Line 97: The first role is the product owner. The primary duties of the product owner
Line 98: include making sure that all team members are pursuing a common vision for
Line 99: the project, establishing priorities so that the highest-valued functionality is al-
Line 100: ways being worked on, and making decisions that lead to a good return on the
Line 101: investment in the project. In commercial software development, the product
Line 102: owner is often someone from the marketing or product management side of the
Line 103: company. When developing software for internal use, the product owner may in-
Line 104: stead be a user, the users’ manager, an analyst, or the person funding the project. 
Line 105: A second role is that of customer. The customer is the person who has made
Line 106: the decision to fund the project or to buy the software. On a project developing
Line 107: software for internal use, the customer is usually a representative from another
Line 108: group or division. On such projects, the product owner and customer roles are
Line 109: often combined. For a commercially distributed product, the customer will be

Line 111: --- 페이지 55 ---
Line 112: 24
Line 113: |
Line 114: Chapter 3
Line 115: An Agile Approach
Line 116: the person who buys the software. In either case, the customer may or may not
Line 117: be a user of the software, which is, of course, another important role.
Line 118: Another role worth highlighting is that of developer. I use developer very
Line 119: generally to refer to anyone developing software. That includes programmers,
Line 120: testers, analysts, database engineers, usability experts, technical writers, archi-
Line 121: tects, designers, and so on. Using this definition, even the product owner may be
Line 122: thought of as a developer on many projects. 
Line 123: A final role is the project manager. As described by Highsmith (2004a), the
Line 124: role of the project manager changes on agile projects. Agile project managers fo-
Line 125: cus more on leadership than on management. On some agile projects, the per-
Line 126: son fufilling the role of project manager will also act in another role, often as a
Line 127: developer but occasionally as a product owner.
Line 128: An Agile Team Works in Short Iterations
Line 129: On an agile project there is no grand delineation of phases—no up-front require-
Line 130: ments phase followed by analysis followed by architectural design and so on. De-
Line 131: pending upon the actual agile process you select or define, you may put a very
Line 132: short design, modeling, or other phase at the front end of the project. But once
Line 133: the project has begun in earnest, all work (analysis, design, coding, testing, and
Line 134: so on) happens concurrently within each iteration.
Line 135: Iterations are timeboxed, meaning they finish on time even if functionality
Line 136: is dropped. Timeboxes are often very short. Most agile teams work in iterations
Line 137: two to four weeks long, but some teams maintain their agility with iterations of
Line 138: up to three months. Most teams settle upon a relatively consistent iteration
Line 139: length. Some, however, choose the appropriate length for an iteration at the
Line 140: start of each iteration. 
Line 141: An Agile Team Delivers Something Each Iteration
Line 142: More crucial than the specific iteration length chosen by a team is that during
Line 143: the iteration they transform one or more imprecise requirements statements
Line 144: into coded, tested, and potentially shippable software. Of course, many teams
Line 145: will not deliver the results of every iteration to their users; the goal is simply that
Line 146: they could. This means that teams make progress by adding one or more small
Line 147: features in each iteration but that each added feature is coded, tested, and of re-
Line 148: leaseable quality.
Line 149: It is essential that the product be brought to this potentially shippable state
Line 150: by the end of each iteration. Practically, this does not mean a team must do
Line 151: 
Line 152: --- 페이지 56 ---
Line 153: An Agile Team Focuses on Business Priorities 
Line 154: |
Line 155: 25
Line 156: absolutely everything necessary to release, because they often won’t release each
Line 157: iteration. For example, I work with one team that requires two months of mean
Line 158: time between failure (MTBF) testing before releasing their product, which in-
Line 159: cludes both hardware and software. They cannot shorten those two months, as it
Line 160: is contractually required by their client, and that amount of time is often neces-
Line 161: sary to check for hardware failures. This team works in four-week iterations, and
Line 162: apart from running this two-month MTBF test, their product is at a truly releas-
Line 163: able state at the end of each iteration.
Line 164: Because a single iteration does not usually provide sufficient time to com-
Line 165: plete enough new functionality to satisfy user or customer desires, the broader
Line 166: concept of a release is introduced. A release comprises one or more (usually
Line 167: more) iterations that build upon one another to complete a set of related func-
Line 168: tionality. Although iterations are most commonly two to four weeks, a release is
Line 169: typically two to six months. For example, in an investment management system,
Line 170: one release may include all of the functionality related to buying and selling mu-
Line 171: tual funds and money market funds. This may take six two-week iterations to
Line 172: complete (roughly three months). A second release may add stock and bond
Line 173: trading and take four additional two-week iterations. Releases may occur at vary-
Line 174: ing intervals. A first release may take six months to be developed. It may be fol-
Line 175: lowed by another release three months later, and so on.
Line 176: An Agile Team Focuses on Business Priorities
Line 177: Agile teams demonstrate a commitment to business priorities in two ways. First,
Line 178: they deliver features in the order specified by the product owner, who is expected
Line 179: to prioritize and combine features into a release that optimizes the return on the
Line 180: organization’s investment in the project. To achieve this, a release plan is created
Line 181: based on the team’s capabilities and a prioritized list of desired new features. For
Line 182: the product owner to have the most flexibility in prioritizing, features must be
Line 183: written so as to minimize the technical dependencies among them. It is difficult
Line 184: for a product owner to prioritize features into a release plan if the selection of
Line 185: one feature requires the prior development of three others. A team is unlikely to
Line 186: achieve a goal of absolutely no dependencies; however, keeping dependencies at
Line 187: a minimum is often quite feasible.
Line 188: Second, agile teams focus on completing and delivering user-valued features
Line 189: rather than on completing isolated tasks (that eventually combine into a user-
Line 190: valued feature). One of the best ways to do this is to work with user stories,
Line 191: which are a lightweight technique for expressing software requirements (Cohn
Line 192: 2004). A user story is a brief description of functionality as viewed by a user or
Line 193: customer of the system. User stories are free-form, and there is no mandatory
Line 194: 
Line 195: --- 페이지 57 ---
Line 196: 26
Line 197: |
Line 198: Chapter 3
Line 199: An Agile Approach
Line 200: syntax. However, it can be useful to think of a story generally fitting this form:
Line 201: “As a <type of user>, I want <capability> so that <business value>.” With this
Line 202: template as an example, you may have the story “As a book buyer, I want to
Line 203: search for a book by ISBN so that I can find the right book quickly.”
Line 204: User stories are lightweight because the work to gather and document them
Line 205: is not all done up front. Rather than writing a lengthy requirements specifica-
Line 206: tion, agile teams have found it better to pursue a just-in-time requirements ap-
Line 207: proach. Typically this begins with a short description of a user story being
Line 208: handwritten on a note card or perhaps typed into a computer for larger or dis-
Line 209: tributed teams. The story card is just the beginning, though, and each user story
Line 210: is accompanied by as many conversations between the developers and the prod-
Line 211: uct owner as needed. These conversations happen as often as needed and include
Line 212: whoever is necessary. Written documentation may continue to exist when a
Line 213: story-based requirements approach is used. However, the focus is shifted dra-
Line 214: matically from written to verbal communication.
Line 215: An Agile Team Inspects and Adapts
Line 216: The plan created at the start of any project is not a guarantee of what will occur.
Line 217: In fact, it is only a point-in-time guess. Many things will conspire to invalidate
Line 218: the plan—project personnel may come or go, technologies will work better or
Line 219: worse than expected, users will change their minds, competitors may force us to
Line 220: respond differently or more rapidly, and so on. Agile teams view every such
Line 221: change as presenting both the opportunity and need to update the plan to better
Line 222: reflect the reality of the current situation. 
Line 223: At the start of each new iteration, an agile team incorporates all new knowl-
Line 224: edge gained in the preceding iteration and adapts accordingly. If a team has
Line 225: learned something that is likely to affect the accuracy or value of the plan, they
Line 226: adjust the plan. The accuracy of the plan may be affected by the team’s discover-
Line 227: ing they have over- or underestimated their rate of progress. Or they may dis-
Line 228: cover that a certain type of work is more time consuming than previously
Line 229: thought.
Line 230: The value of the plan may be altered by knowledge the product owner has
Line 231: gained about the desires of likely users. Perhaps, based on feedback from seeing
Line 232: the software from an earlier iteration, the product owner has learned that users
Line 233: would like to see more of one type of feature and that they don’t value another
Line 234: feature as much as was previously thought. The value of the plan could be in-
Line 235: creased in this case by moving more of the desired features into the release at the
Line 236: expense of some of the lesser-valued features.
Line 237: 
Line 238: --- 페이지 58 ---
Line 239: An Agile Approach to Planning 
Line 240: |
Line 241: 27
Line 242: None of this is to say that agile teams take an ad hoc view of changing prior-
Line 243: ities. Priorities do tend to be relatively stable from one iteration to the next.
Line 244: However, the opportunity to alter priorities between iterations is a powerful con-
Line 245: tributor to the ability to maximize the return on the project investment.
Line 246: An Agile Approach to Planning
Line 247: Estimating and planning the development of a new product is a daunting task
Line 248: made more difficult by our misconceptions about projects. Macomber (2004)
Line 249: points out that we should not view a project solely as the execution of a series of
Line 250: steps. Instead, it is important that we view a project as rapidly and reliably gen-
Line 251: erating a flow of useful new capabilities and new knowledge. The new capabilities
Line 252: are delivered in the product; the new knowledge is used to make the product the
Line 253: best that it can be. 
Line 254: On an agile project, we use this flow of new capabilities and knowledge to
Line 255: guide the ongoing work. The new knowledge generated by the project may be
Line 256: about the product or the project. New product knowledge helps us know more
Line 257: about what the product should be. New project knowledge is information about
Line 258: the team, the technologies in use, the risks, and so on.
Line 259: We frequently fail to acknowledge and plan for this new knowledge. Failing
Line 260: to plan to acquire new knowledge leads to plans built on the assumption that we
Line 261: know everything necessary to create an accurate plan. In the world of software
Line 262: development, that is rarely, if ever, the case. Ward Cunningham has said that “it’s
Line 263: more planning what you want to learn, not what it [the product] will be in the
Line 264: end” (Van Schooenderwoert 2004).
Line 265: I often equate the traditional view of a project as running a 10-kilometer
Line 266: race. You know exactly how far away the finish line is, and your goal is to reach
Line 267: it as quickly as possible. On an an agile project, we don’t know exactly where the
Line 268: finish line is, but we often know we need to get to it or as close as we can by a
Line 269: known date. An agile project is more like a timed race than a 10-kilometer race:
Line 270: run as far as possible in sixty minutes. In this way, the agile project team knows
Line 271: when they will finish but not what they will deliver. When we acknowledge that
Line 272: the result is both somewhat unknown as well as unknowable in advance, plan-
Line 273: ning becomes a process of setting and revising goals that lead to a longer-term
Line 274: objective.

Line 279: Chapter 3
Line 280: An Agile Approach
Line 281: Multiple Levels of Planning
Line 282: When setting and revising goals, it is important to remember that we cannot see
Line 283: past the horizon and that the accuracy of a plan decreases rapidly the further we
Line 284: attempt to plan beyond where we can see. Suppose you are standing on a small
Line 285: boat and that your eyes are nine feet above the water. The distance to the horizon
Line 286: in this case is slightly over four miles.1 If you are planning a twenty-mile trip,
Line 287: you should plan on looking ahead at least five times, once every four miles. Be-
Line 288: cause you cannot see past the horizon, you need to look up occasionally and ad-
Line 289: just your plan. 
Line 290: A project is at risk if its planning extends well beyond the planner’s horizon
Line 291: and does not include time for the planner to raise her head, look at the new ho-
Line 292: rizon, and make adjustments. A progressive elaboration of the plan is needed.
Line 293: Agile teams achieve this by planning at three distinct horizons. The three hori-
Line 294: zons are the release, the iteration, and the current day. The relationships among
Line 295: these (and other) planning horizons are illustrated in the planning onion of
Line 296: Figure 3.1.
Line 297: Figure 3.1 The planning onion. Agile teams plan at least at the release, iteration, 
Line 298: and day levels.
Line 299: Most agile teams are concerned only with the three innermost levels of the
Line 300: planning onion. Release planning considers the user stories or themes that will
Line 301: be developed for a new release of a product or system. The goal of release
Line 302: 1. To calculate the distance to the horizon in miles, multiply the square root of the height
Line 303: of your eyes by 1.35.

Line 313: |
Line 314: 29
Line 315: planning is to determine an appropriate answer to the questions of scope, sched-
Line 316: ule, and resources for a project. Release planning occurs at the start of a project
Line 317: but is not an isolated effort. A good release plan is updated throughout the
Line 318: project (usually at the start of each iteration) so that it always reflects the cur-
Line 319: rent expectations about what will be included in the release.
Line 320: At the next level is iteration planning, which is conducted at the start of each
Line 321: iteration. Based on the work accomplished in the just-finished iteration, the
Line 322: product owner identifies high-priority work the team should address in the new
Line 323: iteration. Because we are looking at a closer horizon than with release planning,
Line 324: the components of the iteration plan can be smaller. During iteration planning,
Line 325: we talk about the tasks that will be needed to transform a feature request into
Line 326: working and tested software.
Line 327: Finally, there is daily planning. Most agile teams use some form of daily
Line 328: stand-up meeting to coordinate work and synchronize daily efforts. Although it
Line 329: may seem excessive to consider this planning in the formal sense, teams defi-
Line 330: nitely make, assess, and revise their plans during these meetings. During their
Line 331: daily meetings, teams constrain the planning horizon to be no further away than
Line 332: the next day, when they will meet again. Because of this, they focus on the plan-
Line 333: ning of tasks and on coordinating the individual activities that lead up to the
Line 334: completion of a task.
Line 335: By planning across these three time horizons—release, iteration, and day—
Line 336: agile teams focus on what is visible and important to the plan they are creating.
Line 337: Outside the concern of most individual agile teams (and this book) are prod-
Line 338: uct, portfolio, and strategic planning. Product planning involves a product
Line 339: owner’s looking further ahead than the immediate release and planning for the
Line 340: evolution of the released product or system. Portfolio planning involves the se-
Line 341: lection of the products that will best implement a vision established through an
Line 342: organization’s strategic planning. 
Line 343: Conditions of Satisfaction
Line 344: Every project is initiated with a set of objectives. Your current project may be to
Line 345: create the world’s best word processor. Creating the world’s best word processor,
Line 346: however, will typically be only one objective for this project. There will almost
Line 347: certainly be additional objectives regarding schedule, budget, and quality. These
Line 348: objectives can be thought of as the the customer or product owner’s conditions
Line 349: of satisfaction—that is, the criteria that will be used to gauge the success of the
Line 350: project.

Line 355: Chapter 3
Line 356: An Agile Approach
Line 357: Way back when I was in high school and assigned to write a paper about a
Line 358: book such as Moby Dick, I would always ask the teacher how long the paper had
Line 359: to be. She’d respond something like “Five pages,” and then I knew her primary
Line 360: condition of satisfaction. There were, of course, a number of additional, unwrit-
Line 361: ten conditions of satisfaction, such as that the paper would be well written, my
Line 362: own work, in English, and so on. 
Line 363: At the start of release planning, the team and product owner collaboratively
Line 364: explore the product owner’s conditions of satisfaction. These include the usual
Line 365: items—scope, schedule, budget, and quality—although agile teams typically
Line 366: prefer to treat quality as non-negotiable. The team and product owner look for
Line 367: ways to meet all of the conditions of satisfaction. The product owner may, for ex-
Line 368: ample, be equally satisfied with a release in five months that includes one set of
Line 369: user stories as with a release a month later that includes additonal user stories.
Line 370: Sometimes, however, all of the product owner’s conditions of satisfaction
Line 371: cannot be met. The team can build the world’s best word processor, but they can-
Line 372: not build it by next month. When no feasible solution can be found, the condi-
Line 373: tions of satisfaction must change. Because of this, release planning and
Line 374: exploration of the product owner’s conditions of satisfaction are highly iterative,
Line 375: as illustrated in Figure 3.2.
Line 376: Once a release plan covering approximately the next three to six months is
Line 377: established, it is used as input into the planning of the first iteration. Just as re-
Line 378: lease planning began with consideration of the product owner’s conditions of
Line 379: satisfaction, so does iteration planning. For an iteration, the product owner’s
Line 380: conditions of satisfaction are typically the features she’d like developed next and
Line 381: some high-level tests about each feature.
Line 382: As an example, consider a travel site that includes the user story “As a user, I
Line 383: want to be able to cancel a reservation.” In discussing this story with the product
Line 384: owner, the developers learn that her conditions of satisfaction for this story
Line 385: include
Line 386: ◆A user who cancels more than twenty-four hours in advance gets a complete
Line 387: refund.
Line 388: ◆A user who cancels less than twenty-four hours in advance is refunded all
Line 389: but a ¤25 cancellation fee.
Line 390: ◆A cancellation code is displayed on the site and is emailed to the user.
Line 391: Like release planning, iteration planning is iterative. The product owner and
Line 392: the team discuss various ways of best meeting the conditions of satisfaction for
Line 393: the iteration.

Line 403: increment during the iteration, the team may have gained knowledge or experi-
Line 404: ence that affects planning at one or more of these levels. Similarly, showing the
Line 405: product increment to existing or likely users may generate new knowledge that
Line 406: would cause changes to the plans. An agile team will incorporate these changes

Line 436: An Agile Approach
Line 437: person paying for the project or purchasing the software once it’s available. Us-
Line 438: ers, developers, and managers are other roles on an agile project. 
Line 439: Agile teams work in short, timeboxed iterations that deliver a working prod-
Line 440: uct by the end of each iteration. The features developed in these iterations are se-
Line 441: lected based on the priority to the business. This ensures that the most
Line 442: important features are developed first. User stories are a common way for agile
Line 443: teams to express user needs. Agile teams understand that a plan can rapidly be-
Line 444: come out of date. Because of this, they adapt their plans as appropriate.
Line 445: Projects should be viewed as rapidly and reliably generating a flow of useful
Line 446: new capabilities and new knowledge, rather than as just the execution of a series
Line 447: of steps. Projects generate two types of new knowledge: knowledge about the
Line 448: product and knowledge about the project. Each is useful in refining a product
Line 449: plan toward achieving the most value for the organization.
Line 450: Agile teams use three levels of planning: release planning, iteration plan-
Line 451: ning, and daily planning. The release plan looks ahead for the duration of the re-
Line 452: lease—typically, three to six months. An iteration plan looks ahead only the
Line 453: duration of one iteration—typically, two to four weeks. A daily plan is the result
Line 454: of team member commitments made to each other in a daily stand-up meeting.
Line 455: Understanding the product owner’s conditions of satisfaction is critical in
Line 456: both release and iteration planning. During release planning, the whole team
Line 457: identifies a way of meeting the conditions of satisfaction for the release, which
Line 458: include scope, schedule, and resources. To achieve this, the product owner may
Line 459: need to relax one or more of her conditions of satisfaction. A similar process oc-
Line 460: curs during iteration planning, when the conditions of satisfaction are the new
Line 461: features that will be implemented and the high-level test cases that demonstrate
Line 462: the features were implemented correctly.
Line 463: Discussion Questions
Line 464: 1. How would working as a unified whole team have affected your current or
Line 465: last project?
Line 466: 2. What are the conditions of satisfaction on your current project? Do all
Line 467: project stakeholders and participants agree on all of them? What risks are
Line 468: there to proceeding on a project that does not have agreement on all condi-
Line 469: tions of satisfaction?
Line 470: 3. Why are budget and schedule listed in Figure 3.2 as conditions of satisfac-

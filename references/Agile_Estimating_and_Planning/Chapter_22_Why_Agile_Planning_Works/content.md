Line 5: Why Agile Planning Works
Line 6: “If you want a guarantee,
Line 7: buy a toaster.”
Line 8: —Clint Eastwood in The Rookie
Line 9: Having arrived at this point, we are well equipped to look at why agile estimating
Line 10: and planning are successful. First, remember the purpose of estimating and
Line 11: planning. Planning is an attempt to find an optimal solution to the overall prod-
Line 12: uct development question: features, resources, and schedule. Changing any one
Line 13: of these causes changes in the others. While planning, we are exploring the en-
Line 14: tire spectrum of possible solutions of how to mix these three parameters such
Line 15: that we create the best product possible. The estimates and plans that we create
Line 16: must be sufficient for serving as the basis for decisons that will be made by the
Line 17: organization. In this chapter, we consider the agile estimating and planning pro-
Line 18: cess described so far by this book to see how it achieves these goals.
Line 19: Replanning Occurs Frequently
Line 20: One of the ways in which agile estimating and planning support the efficient ex-
Line 21: ploration of the new product development solution space is through frequent re-
Line 22: planning. At the start of each new iteration, a plan for that iteration is created.
Line 23: The release plan is updated either after each iteration or, at worst, after every few
Line 24: iterations. Acknowledging the impossibility of creating a perfect plan goes a long
Line 25: way toward reducing the anxiety that accompanies such a goal (Githens 1998).

Line 29: Chapter 22
Line 30: Why Agile Planning Works
Line 31: Knowing that a plan can be revised at the start of the next iteration shifts a
Line 32: team’s focus from creating a perfect plan (an impossible goal) to creating a plan
Line 33: that is useful right now. 
Line 34: For a plan to be useful, it must be accurate, but we accept that early plans
Line 35: will be imprecise. One of the reasons we replan is to remove that imprecision
Line 36: progressively. That is, an early plan may say that a project will deliver 300 to 400
Line 37: story points in the third quarter. That plan may later turn out to be accurate (305
Line 38: story points are delivered in August), but this plan is not particularly precise.
Line 39: During the early stages of a project, this plan may very likely be a sufficient basis
Line 40: for making decisions. Later, though, to remain useful, the plan will gain preci-
Line 41: sion, and we may say that the project will deliver 380 to 400 story points in Sep-
Line 42: tember.
Line 43: An agile estimating and planning process recognizes that our knowledge is
Line 44: always incomplete and requires that plans be revised as we learn. As a team
Line 45: learns more about the product they are building, new features may be added to
Line 46: the release plan. As the team learns more about the technologies they are using
Line 47: or about how well they are working together, expectations about their rate of
Line 48: progress are adjusted. For a plan to remain useful, this new knowledge needs to
Line 49: be incorporated into the plan.
Line 50: Estimates of Size and Duration Are Separated
Line 51: A common planning flaw (on traditional as well as many agile teams) is confus-
Line 52: ing estimates of size and duration. Clearly, the size of an effort and the time
Line 53: needed to complete that effort are related, but many additional factors affect du-
Line 54: ration. A project of a given size will take programmers of different skill and expe-
Line 55: rience levels different amounts of time. Similarly, duration is affected by the size
Line 56: of the team working on the project. A four-person team may take six months
Line 57: (twenty-four person-months). An eight-person team may reduce that to four cal-
Line 58: endar months but thirty-two person-months, even though the project is the
Line 59: same size in both cases.
Line 60: To see the difference between estimates of size and duration, suppose I show
Line 61: you a book and ask you how long it will take you to read it. You can tell from its
Line 62: title that it’s a novel, but I won’t let you look inside the book to see how many
Line 63: pages are in it, how wide the margins are, or how small the type is. To answer my
Line 64: question about how long it will take you to read this book, you first estimate the
Line 65: number of pages. Let’s assume you say 600. Then you estimate your rate of
Line 66: progress at one page per minute. You tell me it will take you 600 minutes, or 10
Line 67: 
Line 68: --- 페이지 282 ---
Line 69: Plans Are Made at Different Levels 
Line 70: |
Line 71: 251
Line 72: hours. In arriving at this estimate of duration (10 hours), you first estimated the
Line 73: size of the job (600 pages). 
Line 74: Agile estimating and planning succeed because estimates of size and dura-
Line 75: tion are separated. We start by estimating the size of a project’s user stories in
Line 76: story points. Because story points are abstract and notional, they are pure esti-
Line 77: mates of size. We then estimate a rate of progress, which we call velocity. Our es-
Line 78: timates of size and velocity are then combined to arrive at an estimate of
Line 79: duration. Our estimating and planning process benefits from this clear and total
Line 80: separation of estimates of size and duration.
Line 81: Plans Are Made at Different Levels
Line 82: Because agile plans cover three different levels—the release, the iteration, and
Line 83: the current day—each plan can be made with a different level of precision. Hav-
Line 84: ing plans with different time horizons and different levels of precision has two
Line 85: main benefits. First, it conveys the reality that the different plans are created for
Line 86: different reasons. The daily plan, as committed to by each participant in a team’s
Line 87: daily meeting, is fairly precise: Individuals express commitments to complete, or
Line 88: at least make progress on, specific tasks during the day. The iteration plan is less
Line 89: precise, listing the user stories that will be developed during an iteration and the
Line 90: tasks thought necessary to do so. Because each user story is imperfectly speci-
Line 91: fied, there is also some vagueness around what it means to say that the story will
Line 92: be developed in the iteration. Finally, the release plan is the least precise of all,
Line 93: containing only a prioritized list of desired user stories and one or more esti-
Line 94: mates of how much of the desired functionality is likely to be delivered by the de-
Line 95: sired release date.
Line 96: The second benefit of planning at different levels is that it helps the team
Line 97: view the project from different perspectives. An iteration plan is necessary for
Line 98: completing the highly coordinated work of a cross-functional team within a
Line 99: short iteration. A release plan provides a broader perspective on the project and
Line 100: ensures that the team does not lose the forest of the release for the trees of an
Line 101: iteration. A team that works iteration to iteration without awareness of a more
Line 102: distant goal runs the risk of continually pursuing short-term goals while miss-
Line 103: ing out on targeting a truly lucrative longer-term goal. Short-term goals may be
Line 104: inconsistent with the desired long-term result.

Line 109: Why Agile Planning Works
Line 110: Plans Are Based on Features, Not Tasks
Line 111: A traditional plan in the form of a Gantt chart, PERT chart, or work breakdown
Line 112: structure focuses on the tasks needed to create a product. An agile plan focuses
Line 113: instead on the features that will be needed in the product. This is a key distinc-
Line 114: tion, because it forces the team to think about the product at the right level—
Line 115: the features. When features are developed iteratively, there is less need for up-
Line 116: front thinking about the specific tasks necessary. The work of an iteration
Line 117: emerges, and the team will think of or discover all of the tasks as they are
Line 118: needed. What’s more important is that the team think about the features that are
Line 119: being developed. Colleague Jim Highsmith (2004b) has stated that “agile plan-
Line 120: ning is ‘better’ planning because it utilizes features (stories, etc.) rather than
Line 121: tasks. It is easy to plan an entire project using standard tasks without really un-
Line 122: derstanding the product being built. When planning by feature, the team has a
Line 123: much better understanding of the product.” At a task level, many project plans
Line 124: look the same; every agile plan is specific to the product being developed.
Line 125: Small Stories Keep Work Flowing
Line 126: From queuing theory (Poppendieck and Poppendieck 2003; Reinertsen 1997),
Line 127: we learn the importance of focusing on cycle time, the amount of time some-
Line 128: thing takes to go from the start of a process to the end of that process. On a soft-
Line 129: ware project, cycle time is the time from when the team begins work on a feature
Line 130: until that feature delivers value to users. The shorter the cycle time, the better. 
Line 131: A key influence on cycle time is the variability in the time it takes to develop
Line 132: a new feature. One of the best ways to reduce variability is to work with reason-
Line 133: ably small and similar size units of work. The estimating and planning process
Line 134: outlined in this book supports this by advising that teams estimate their short-
Line 135: term work within approximately one order of magnitude. Larger user stories can
Line 136: exist further down a project’s prioritized requirements list. However, as those
Line 137: features near the the top of the list (when they will be scheduled into an iteration
Line 138: that is beginning), they are disaggregated into smaller pieces. 
Line 139: Work in Process Is Eliminated Every Iteration
Line 140: High amounts of work in process slow a team. On a software project, work in
Line 141: process exists on any feature that the team has started developing but has not yet
Line 142: finished. The more work in process there is, the longer any new feature will take
Line 143: to develop, as the new feature must follow the already-started work. (Or the new
Line 144: 
Line 145: --- 페이지 284 ---
Line 146: Uncertainty Is Acknowledged and Planned For 
Line 147: |
Line 148: 253
Line 149: feature needs to be expedited, jumping ahead of the work in process, but that
Line 150: just compounds the problem for the next feature that cannot be expedited.) So
Line 151: work in process leads to increased cycle times. And in the previous section, we
Line 152: learned the importance of maintaining a short cycle time.
Line 153: One of the reasons why agile planning succeeds is that all work in process is
Line 154: eliminated at the end of each iteration. Because work is not automatically rolled
Line 155: forward from one iteration to the next, each iteration is planned afresh. This
Line 156: means that work on a feature not fully implemented in one iteration will not
Line 157: necessarily be continued in the next. It often will be, but there’s no guarantee.
Line 158: This has the effect of eliminating all work in process at the start of each
Line 159: iteration.
Line 160: Because work in process is eliminated at the start of each iteration, teams
Line 161: are more easily able to work efficiently in short iterations. This means a shorter
Line 162: feedback loop from users to the project team, which leads to faster learning as
Line 163: well as more timely risk mitigation and control.
Line 164: Tracking Is at the Team Level
Line 165: Traditional approaches to estimating and planning measure and reward progress
Line 166: at the individual team member level. This leads to a variety of problems. For ex-
Line 167: ample, if finishing a task early results in a programmer’s being accused of giving
Line 168: a padded estimate for the task, the programmer will learn not to finish early.
Line 169: Rather than finish early, she won’t report a task as complete until its deadline.
Line 170: Agile estimating and planning successfully avert this type of problem by
Line 171: tracking progress only at the team level. This is one of the reasons that
Line 172: Chapter 14, “Iteration Planning,” included the advice that individuals should re-
Line 173: frain from signing up for specific tasks during iteration planning. Similarly,
Line 174: there are no individual burndown charts prepared—only a teamwide burndown
Line 175: chart. 
Line 176: Uncertainty Is Acknowledged and Planned For
Line 177: Many traditional, prescriptive plans make the mistake of believing that features
Line 178: can be locked down at the beginning of a project. Plans are then made that do
Line 179: not allow changes or force changes through an onerous change control process.
Line 180: This leads us to delivering projects with features that users don’t want. When we
Line 181: create a plan early in a project and do not update the plan as we acquire new
Line 182: knowledge, we lose the opportunity to synchronize the plan with reality.

Line 186: Chapter 22
Line 187: Why Agile Planning Works
Line 188: With an agile approach to estimating and planning, teams acknowledge both
Line 189: end and means uncertainty. End uncertainty (about the product ultimately be-
Line 190: ing built) is reduced as product increments are shown to potential users and
Line 191: other stakeholders at the end of each iteration. Their feedback and responses are
Line 192: used to fine-tune future plans. Means uncertainty (about how the product will be
Line 193: built) is reduced as the team learns more about the technologies in use and
Line 194: themselves. Early discovery that a particular third-party component cannot
Line 195: meet performance requirements, for example, may lead the team to find an al-
Line 196: ternative. The time to find and switch to the new component will need to be fac-
Line 197: tored into new plans once the need is identified.
Line 198: A Dozen Guidelines for Agile Estimating and Planning
Line 199: With all of these reasons in mind, the following is a list of a dozen guidelines for
Line 200: successful agile estimating and planning.
Line 201: 1. Involve the whole team. Primary responsibility for certain activities may fall
Line 202: to one person or group, as prioritizing requirements is primarily the respon-
Line 203: sibility of the product owner. However, the whole team needs to be involved
Line 204: and committed to the pursuit of the highest-value project possible. We see
Line 205: this, for example, in the advice that estimating is best done by the whole
Line 206: team, even though it may be apparent that only one or two specific team
Line 207: members will work on the story or task being estimated. The more responsi-
Line 208: bilities are shared by the team, the more success the team will have to share.
Line 209: 2. Plan at different levels. Do not make the mistake of thinking that a release
Line 210: plan makes an iteration plan unnecessary, or the other way around. The re-
Line 211: lease, iteration, and daily plans each cover a different time horizon with a
Line 212: different level of precision, and each serves a unique purpose.
Line 213: 3. Keep estimates of size and duration separate by using different units. The
Line 214: best way to maintain a clear distinction between an estimate of size and one
Line 215: of duration is to use separate units that cannot be confused. Estimating size
Line 216: in story points and translating size into duration using velocity is an excel-
Line 217: lent way of doing this.
Line 218: 4. Express uncertainty in either the functionality or the date. No plan is cer-
Line 219: tain. Be sure to include an expression of uncertainty in any release plan you
Line 220: produce. If the amount of new functionality is fixed, state your uncertainty
Line 221: as a date range (“We’ll finish in the third quarter” or “We’ll finish in between
Line 222: seven and ten iterations”). If the date is fixed instead, express uncertainty
Line 223: 
Line 224: --- 페이지 286 ---
Line 225: A Dozen Guidelines for Agile Estimating and Planning 
Line 226: |
Line 227: 255
Line 228: about the exact functionality to be delivered (“We’ll be done on December
Line 229: 31, and the product will include at least these new features, but probably no
Line 230: more than those other new features”). Use bigger units (iterations, months,
Line 231: and then quarters, for example) when the amount of uncertainty is greater.
Line 232: 5. Replan often. Take advantage of the start of each new iteration to assess the
Line 233: relevancy of the current release plan. If the release plan is based on outdated
Line 234: information or on assumptions that are now false, update it. Use replanning
Line 235: opportunities to ensure that the project is always targeted at delivering the
Line 236: greatest value to the organization.
Line 237: 6. Track and communicate progress. Many of a project’s stakeholders will have
Line 238: a very strong interest in the progress of the project. Keep them informed by
Line 239: regularly publishing simple, very understandable indicators of the team’s
Line 240: progress. Burndown charts and other at-a-glance indicators of project
Line 241: progress are best.
Line 242: 7. Acknowledge the importance of learning. Because a project is as much
Line 243: about generating new knowledge as it is about adding new capabilities to a
Line 244: product, plans must be updated to include this new knowledge. As we learn
Line 245: more about our customers’ needs, new features are added to the project. As
Line 246: we learn more about the technologies we are using or about how well we are
Line 247: working as a team, we adjust expectations about our rate of progress and our
Line 248: desired approach.
Line 249: 8. Plan features of the right size. Functionality that will be added in the near
Line 250: future (within the next few iterations) should be decomposed into relatively
Line 251: small user stories—typically, items that will take one or two days up to no
Line 252: more than ten days. We are best at estimating work that is all within one or-
Line 253: der of magnitude in size. Working with user stories that fall within these
Line 254: ranges will provide the best combination of effort and accuracy. It will also
Line 255: provide stories that are small enough to be completed during one iteration
Line 256: for most teams. Of course, working with small user stories can become quite
Line 257: an effort on longer projects. To balance this, if you are creating a release plan
Line 258: that will look more than two or three months into the future, either write
Line 259: some larger stories (called epics) or estimate the more distant work at the
Line 260: theme level to avoid decomposing large stories into small ones too far in
Line 261: advance.
Line 262: 9. Prioritize features. Work on features in the order that optimizes the total
Line 263: value of the project. In addition to the value and cost of features when prior-
Line 264: itizing, consider the learning that will occur and the risk that will be re-
Line 265: duced by developing a feature. Early elimination of a signficant risk can
Line 266: often justify developing a feature early. Similarly, if developing a particular
Line 267: 
Line 268: --- 페이지 287 ---
Line 269: 256 |
Line 270: Chapter 22
Line 271: Why Agile Planning Works
Line 272: feature early will allow the team to gain significant knowledge about the
Line 273: product or their effort to develop it, they should consider developing that
Line 274: feature early.
Line 275: 10. Base estimates and plans on facts. Whenever possible, ground your esti-
Line 276: mates and plans in reality. Yes, there may be times in some organizations
Line 277: when it will be necessary to estimate things like velocity with very little basis
Line 278: in fact, and Chapter 16, “Estimating Velocity,” presented some valid tech-
Line 279: niques for doing so. However, whenever possible, estimates and plans should
Line 280: be based on real, observed values. This goes, too, for an estimate of how
Line 281: much of a feature is complete. It’s easy to tell when a feature is 0% done (we
Line 282: haven’t started it), and it’s relatively easy to tell when we’re 100% done (all
Line 283: tests pass for all of the product owner’s conditions of satisfaction). It’s hard
Line 284: to measure anywhere in between—is this task 50% done or 60% done? Be-
Line 285: cause that question is so hard, stick with what you can know: 0% and 100%.
Line 286: 11. Leave some slack. Especially when planning an iteration, do not plan on us-
Line 287: ing 100% of every team member’s time. Just as a highway experiences grid-
Line 288: lock when filled to 100% capacity, so will a development team slow down
Line 289: when every person’s time is planned to full capacity.
Line 290: 12. Coordinate teams through lookahead planning. On a project involving mul-
Line 291: tiple teams, coordinate their work through rolling lookahead planning. By
Line 292: looking ahead and allocating specific features to specific upcoming itera-
Line 293: tions, interteam dependencies can be planned and accommodated.
Line 294: Summary
Line 295: The purpose of agile planning is to discover iteratively an optimal solution to the
Line 296: overall product development questions of which features with which resources
Line 297: in what timeline. An agile approach to estimating and planning succeeds in find-
Line 298: ing such a solution because plans are made at different levels and replanning oc-
Line 299: curs frequently; because plans are based on features rather than tasks; because
Line 300: size is estimated first and then duration is derived from the size estimate; be-
Line 301: cause small stories keep work flowing, and work in process is eliminated at the
Line 302: end of every iteration; because progress is measured at the team, rather than the
Line 303: individual, level; and because uncertainty is acknowledged and planned for.

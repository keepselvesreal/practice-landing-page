Line 5: Estimating in Ideal Days
Line 6: “To achieve great things, two things are needed:
Line 7: a plan, and not quite enough time.”
Line 8: —Leonard Bernstein
Line 9: How long is a game of American football?
Line 10: You could answer that it has four fifteen-minute quarters and is therefore
Line 11: sixty minutes long. Or you could answer that it is somewhere around three
Line 12: hours long. Either answer would be correct in its own way. The difference high-
Line 13: lights the distinction between ideal time and elapsed time. Ideal time is the
Line 14: amount of time that something takes when stripped of all peripheral activities.
Line 15: In that sense, a football game takes sixty minutes. Elapsed time, on the other
Line 16: hand, is the amount of time that passes on a clock (or perhaps a calendar). A
Line 17: football game requires around three hours of elapsed time.
Line 18: Each way of measuring duration serves its own purpose. In a football game,
Line 19: ideal time is used by the officials to know when the quarters and game are com-
Line 20: plete. Certainly, that is a necessary function. On the other hand, if you’re going
Line 21: to the game, and your spouse asks how long you’ll be gone, it does you no good
Line 22: to say you’ll be gone sixty minutes. Rather, you’ll be gone for three hours (plus
Line 23: whatever travel time is needed).
Line 24: It is almost always far easier and more accurate to predict the duration of an
Line 25: event in ideal time than in elapsed time. Suppose you are asked to estimate the
Line 26: duration of a specific football game this weekend. If you choose to give your esti-
Line 27: mate in ideal time, you can give a quick, off-the-cuff answer of sixty minutes. If

Line 33: Estimating in Ideal Days
Line 34: you want to give a more precise estimate, you might look up the number of over-
Line 35: time games last year, crunch some numbers, and announce that, based on his-
Line 36: torical averages, this weekend’s game will last 62.3 minutes.
Line 37: On the other hand, suppose you choose to express your estimate in elapsed
Line 38: time. Some games last year took two-and-a-half hours; other games took over
Line 39: four hours. Some of the difference is based on random events such as injuries,
Line 40: but another part of the difference can be attributed to the playing styles of the
Line 41: teams, how many penalties each receives, and so on. Televised games take longer
Line 42: because of extra timeouts for commercials. Weather can either prolong or
Line 43: shorten games, depending on the teams involved. To come up with an estimate
Line 44: that will be as accurate as your off-the-cuff ideal time estimate, you would need
Line 45: to consider each of these factors.
Line 46: Of course, if I look at the programming guide on my television, it tells me
Line 47: that the game starts at 1:00 and ends at 4:00. Clearly, someone at the network
Line 48: has made a prediction in elapsed time. What do they know that we don’t know? A
Line 49: number of things. First, they plan to add or remove a few commercials based on
Line 50: how quickly the game is progressing. Second, most games are somewhere close
Line 51: to three hours. If the game finishes earlier, the network will run extra commer-
Line 52: cials, interviews, or other filler. If the game goes long, so what? Viewers inter-
Line 53: ested in the game are likely to continue watching for another fifteen or thirty
Line 54: minutes. They won’t turn the game off simply because the program guide said it
Line 55: should be over at 4:00. Viewers who aren’t interested in the game but have tuned
Line 56: to the channel to watch a different show at 4:00 will also likely wait if the delay
Line 57: isn’t too long. Finally, after decades of televising football games, the networks
Line 58: have accustomed us not to expect a precise finish time.
Line 59: This last difference is an important one. After years of this, most football
Line 60: fans know that when a football game is scheduled to end at 4:00, that is only an
Line 61: estimate. No one is surprised when the game goes till 4:15 (an overrun of 8%).
Line 62: They may be frustrated or annoyed but not surprised. Why, then, are we sur-
Line 63: prised when a software project estimated at twelve months takes thirteen (an
Line 64: equivalent 8% overrun)? Which duration seems harder to estimate?
Line 65: Ideal Time and Software Development
Line 66: On a software project, ideal time differs from elapsed time not because of time-
Line 67: outs, incomplete passes, and injuries, but because of the natural overhead we ex-
Line 68: perience every day. On any given day, in addition to working on the planned
Line 69: activities of a project, a team member may spend time answering email, making
Line 70: a support call to a vendor, interviewing a candidate for the open analyst position,
Line 71:

Line 76: and attending two meetings. More examples of why ideal time does not equal
Line 77: elapsed time are

Line 79: ◆Sick time

Line 81: ◆Demonstrations
Line 82: ◆Personnel issues
Line 83: ◆Phone calls

Line 85: ◆Training
Line 86: ◆Email
Line 87: ◆Reviews and walk-throughs
Line 88: ◆Interviewing candidates
Line 89: ◆Task switching
Line 90: ◆Bug fixing in current releases
Line 91: ◆Management reviews
Line 92: Additionally, in looking at why ideal time does not equal elapsed time, con-
Line 93: sider that managers are able to work an average of only five minutes between in-
Line 94: terruptions (Hobbs 1987). Even if the typical developer is interrupted only one-
Line 95: third as often, that is still an interruption every fifteen minutes.
Line 96: Problems can arise when a manager asks a team member the inevitable
Line 97: question: “How long will this take?” The team member responds, “Five days,” so
Line 98: the manager counts off five days on her calendar and marks the day with a big
Line 99: red X. The team member, however, really meant to say, “Five days if that’s all I
Line 100: do, but I do a lot of other things, so probably two weeks.” 
Line 101: On a software project, multitasking also broadens the gap between ideal
Line 102: time and elapsed time. A football player is never told by his coach, “Since you’re
Line 103: not busy on every play, I want you to play in this high-priority hockey game at
Line 104: the same time.” A software developer who is told to multitask loses a great deal
Line 105: of efficiency while switching between two (or more) tasks. 
Line 106: On a software project, we may choose to estimate user stories or other work
Line 107: in ideal days. When estimating in ideal days, you assume

Line 117: Ideal Days as a Measure of Size
Line 118: When we estimate the number of ideal days that a user story will take to develop,
Line 119: test, and accept, it is not necessary to consider the impact of the overhead of the
Line 120: environment in which the team works. If developing a particular screen will take
Line 121: me one ideal day, it will take me one ideal day regardless of whether I’m em-
Line 122: ployed by a start-up with no overhead or other demands on my time or by a huge
Line 123: bureaucracy. The amount of time that elapses on a clock (or calendar) will differ,
Line 124: of course. I may be able to achieve close to an ideal day of work at a low-overhead
Line 125: start-up. As additional demands are placed on my time, I have less time to work
Line 126: on deliverables for the project, and the amount of elapsed time to complete one
Line 127: ideal day of work will increase.
Line 128: When considerations of organizational overhead are ignored, ideal days can
Line 129: be thought of as another estimate of size, just as story points are. Then an
Line 130: estimate of size expressed as a number of ideal days can be converted into an es-
Line 131: timate of duration using velocity in exactly the same way as with story points.
Line 132: One Estimate, Not Many
Line 133: If you choose to estimate in ideal days, assign one aggregate estimate to each
Line 134: user story. Some teams are tempted to estimate a number of ideal days for each
Line 135: individual or group who will work on a story. For example, such a team might
Line 136: estimate that a particular user story will take two ideal days from a programmer,
Line 137: one ideal day from a database engineer, one ideal day from a user interaction de-
Line 138: signer, and two ideal days from a tester. I’ve seen teams then write the estimate
Line 139: on the story card with a different-colored marker for each role or on a different-
Line 140: colored sticky piece of paper for each role that is affixed to the story card.
Line 141: In the vast majority of cases, my advice is not to do this. This level of focus
Line 142: on the individual roles on a team shifts team thinking away from the “we’re all in
Line 143: this together” mentality we’d like to exist on an agile team. Further, it vastly in-
Line 144: creases the amount of work necessary to plan a release. If each story is assigned
Line 145: an estimate for each role that will work on the story, the release plan should re-
Line 146: alistically take each role into account. This means we’d have to track velocity and
Line 147: remaining work for each role as well.

Line 153: While this is rarely worth the additional effort, it may sometimes be neces-
Line 154: sary. I was with one client recently who is working on three versions of a prod-
Line 155: uct—one for the Macintosh, one for Windows, and one for handheld computers.
Line 156: In this case, it is absolutely critical that each version be released with exactly the
Line 157: same functionality. Further, the individuals on this team do not currently have
Line 158: the skills to switch among Mac, Windows, and handheld development. A team in
Line 159: this situation may want to estimate the ideal time for each role on each story.
Line 160: They should, however, be aware of the extra administrative burden this will
Line 161: require.
Line 162: Summary
Line 163: Ideal time and elapsed time are different. The ideal time of a game of American
Line 164: football is sixty minutes (four fifteen-minute quarters). However, three or more
Line 165: hours will typically pass on a clock before a sixty-minute game is finished. The
Line 166: reason for the difference, of course, is all the interruptions that may occur dur-
Line 167: ing the game.
Line 168: The amount of time a user story will take to develop can be more easily esti-
Line 169: mated in ideal days than in elapsed days. Estimating in elapsed days requires us
Line 170: to consider all of the interruptions that might occur while working on the story.
Line 171: If we instead estimate in ideal days, we consider only the amount of time the
Line 172: story will take. In this way, ideal days are an estimate of size, although less
Line 173: strictly so than story points.
Line 174: When estimating in ideal days, it is best to associate a single estimate with
Line 175: each user story. Rather than estimating that a user story will take four program-
Line 176: mer days, two tester days, and three product owner days, it is better to sum those
Line 177: and say the story as a whole will take nine ideal days.
Line 178: Discussion Questions
Line 179: 1. If an ideal day is eight hours of uninterrupted, focused work, how many
Line 180: hours of elapsed time in your enviornment equates to one ideal day?
Line 181: 2. What might you be able to do to improve this?

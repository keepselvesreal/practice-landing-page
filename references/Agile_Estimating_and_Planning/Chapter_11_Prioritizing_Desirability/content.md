Line 9: As I write this I am sitting in a hotel room. The room has a bed, a bathroom, and
Line 10: a desk, and is reasonably clean. Each of these features is a basic attribute I expect
Line 11: of every hotel room. If any of these were absent, I would not stay at the hotel.
Line 12: This hotel also has a bed that is more comfortable than most, includes free wire-
Line 13: less Internet access, is larger than most hotel rooms, and has a fitness center. I
Line 14: really appreciate these additional features, but they are not mandatory for me to
Line 15: stay at a hotel. However, the more features like this the hotel offers, the more I’m
Line 16: willing to pay for a room here. Finally, this hotel delighted me in two ways: Each
Line 17: treadmill in the fitness center has a television built into it, and a free bottle of
Line 18: water was left in my room each day.
Line 19: I could group the features of this hotel room into the following categories:
Line 20: ◆Must-haves: a bed, a bathroom, a desk, clean
Line 21: ◆The more, the better: comfort of the bed, size of the room, variety and quan-
Line 22: tity of equipment in the fitness center
Line 23: ◆Exciting: built-in televisions on the treadmills, free bottle of water in my
Line 24: room each day

Line 29: Prioritizing Desirability
Line 30: Kano Model of Customer Satisfaction
Line 31: Separating product features into the previous three categories can provide a
Line 32: great deal of information about how to prioritize work for a new product release.
Line 33: The process of doing so was originated by Noriaki Kano, whose approach gives us
Line 34: a way to separate features into three categories:
Line 35: ◆Threshold, or must-have, features
Line 36: ◆Linear features
Line 37: ◆Exciters and delighters
Line 38: Threshold features are those that must be present in the product for it to be
Line 39: successful. They are often referred to as must-have features. These are the bed,
Line 40: bathroom, desk, and cleanliness of my hotel room. Improving the performance
Line 41: or amount of a threshold feature will have little impact on customer satisfaction.
Line 42: For example, as long as the hotel bathroom meets my basic needs I don’t care
Line 43: what the countertops are made from. 
Line 44: A linear feature is one for which “the more, the better” holds true. The big-
Line 45: ger the hotel room is, the better. These are called linear features because cus-
Line 46: tomer satisfaction is correlated linearly with the quantity of the feature. The
Line 47: better one of these features performs (or the more of it there is), the more satis-
Line 48: fied the customers will be. Because of this, product price is often related to linear
Line 49: attributes. If the hotel has dumbbells and two nice treadmills, I’ll be happier
Line 50: than if it just has one rusty old stair climber. I’ll be even happier if it also has el-
Line 51: liptical trainers and spinning bikes. And important for the hotel, I’ll be more
Line 52: likely to return and to pay a premium for its rooms.
Line 53: Finally, exciters and delighters are those features that provide great satisfac-
Line 54: tion, often adding a price premium to a product. However, the lack of an exciter
Line 55: or delighter will not decrease customer satisfaction below neutral. The built-in
Line 56: television on the hotel’s treadmill was an exciter for me. I would not have been
Line 57: dissatisfied if the hotel didn’t offer these because I didn’t know anyone had them.
Line 58: In fact, exciters and delighters are often called unknown needs because custom-
Line 59: ers or users do not know they need these features until they see them.
Line 60: The relationship among these three different feature types is shown in
Line 61: Figure 11.1. The arrow through the bottom right of this diagram shows that
Line 62: once some amount of a must-have feature has been implemented, customer sat-
Line 63: isfaction cannot be increased by adding more of that feature. Also, no matter
Line 64: how much of a must-have feature is added, customer satisfaction never rises
Line 65: above the midpoint.

Line 70: 113
Line 71: On the other hand, the line in the top left shows that customer satisfaction
Line 72: rises dramatically based on even a partial implementation of an exciter or de-
Line 73: lighter. Finally, the line through the middle shows the direct relationship be-
Line 74: tween the inclusion of linear features and customer satisfaction.
Line 75: Figure 11.1 The Kano model of customer satisfaction.
Line 76: Because must-have features are required for a product to play in its market
Line 77: segment, emphasis should be placed on prioritizing the development of all
Line 78: threshold features. A product’s must-have features do not need to be developed
Line 79: in the first iterations of a release. However, because users consider these features
Line 80: to be mandatory, they need to be available before the product is released. Keep in
Line 81: mind, though, that partial implementation of must-have features may be ade-
Line 82: quate, because gains in customer satisfaction drop off quickly after a base level of
Line 83: support for threshold features has been established. For example, I am writing
Line 84: this book with Adobe FrameMaker, which pays lip service to an undo feature by
Line 85: allowing one level of undo. For me personally, they moved pretty far up the cus-
Line 86: tomer satisfaction axis with a one-level undo feature, yet I would have preferred
Line 87: much more.

Line 104: Prioritizing Desirability
Line 105: Secondary emphasis should be placed on completing as many linear features
Line 106: as possible. Because each of these features leads directly to greater customer sat-
Line 107: isfaction, the more of these features that can be included, the better (excluding,
Line 108: of course, such situations as a product that is already bloated with too many fea-
Line 109: tures). Finally and with time permitting, at least a few delighters should be pri-
Line 110: oritized such that they are included in the release plan. 
Line 111: Keep in mind that features tend to migrate down the Kano diagram over
Line 112: time. A short time ago, wireless Internet access in a hotel room was a delighter.
Line 113: Now it’s a linear feature well on its way to becoming a threshold feature.
Line 114: Assessing Themes on the Kano Model
Line 115: The easiest way to make use of a Kano model on an agile project is to think about
Line 116: each theme and make an educated guess about the type of each. A much better
Line 117: way, however, is to speak with customers or users to determine the type of each
Line 118: theme. This is surprisingly easy because it can be done with a written question-
Line 119: naire and you may need to survey as few as twenty to thirty users to accurately
Line 120: prioritize requirements (Griffin and Hauser 1993).
Line 121: Kano proposed determining the category of a feature by asking two ques-
Line 122: tions: one question regarding how the user would feel if the feature were present
Line 123: in the product and one question about how the user would feel if it were absent.
Line 124: The first of these questions is known as the functional form, because it refers to
Line 125: the case when a function is present. The second question is known as the dys-
Line 126: functional form, because it refers to when the function is not present. Each
Line 127: question is answered on the same five-point scale.
Line 128: 1. I like it that way.
Line 129: 2. I expect it to be that way.
Line 130: 3. I am neutral.
Line 131: 4. I can live with it that way.
Line 132: 5. I dislike it that way.
Line 133: As an example, let’s return to the SwimStats website. Suppose we are con-
Line 134: templating three new features:
Line 135: ◆The ability to see a graph of a swimmer’s times in an event over the past
Line 136: season.
Line 137: ◆The ability for swimmers to post autobiographical profiles.

Line 140: Assessing Themes on the Kano Model 
Line 141: |
Line 142: 115
Line 143: ◆The ability for any registered site member to upload photos.
Line 144: To determine which type of feature these are, we survey prospective users,
Line 145: asking them:
Line 146: ◆If you can graph a swimmer’s times in an event over the past season, how do
Line 147: you feel?
Line 148: ◆If you cannot graph a swimmer’s times in an event over the past season, how
Line 149: do you feel?
Line 150: ◆If swimmers can post autobiographical profiles, how do you feel?
Line 151: ◆If swimmers cannot post autobiographical profiles, how do you feel?
Line 152: ◆If you can upload photos, how do you feel?
Line 153: ◆If you cannot upload photos, how do you feel?
Line 154: The first pair of these questions and hypothetical answers from one user are
Line 155: shown in Figure 11.2.
Line 156: Figure 11.2 The functional and dysfunctional forms of a question.
Line 157: From looking at Figure 11.2, it’s apparent that it is possible for a user to give
Line 158: inconsistent responses. A user could, for example, say that she likes graphing a
Line 159: swimmer’s event times and that she also likes not having the same feature.
Line 160: There are twenty-five possible combinations of answers to the functional and

Line 164: I am neutral.
Line 165: I can live with it that way.

Line 168: I expect it to be that way.

Line 196: Categorizing Responses
Line 197: The method for doing this is shown in Figure 11.3. By cross-referencing the an-
Line 198: swer to the functional question with the answer to the dysfunctional question, a
Line 199: prospective user’s responses can be reduced to a single meaning. So if a user says
Line 200: she expects to be able to graph event times and that she would dislike it if it did
Line 201: not (which are the answers given in Figure 11.2), we cross-reference those an-
Line 202: swers and get that she considers the feature to be mandatory. In her mind,
Line 203: graphing event times is a must-have feature.
Line 204: Figure 11.3 Categorizing a feature from answers to a pair of questions.
Line 205: If we repeat this process over twenty to thirty users, their answers can be ag-
Line 206: gregated and their distributions determined as is shown in Table 11.1. From ex-
Line 207: amining this table, we can tell that graphing event times is a one-dimensional

Line 262: Relative Weighting: Another Approach 
Line 263: |
Line 264: 117
Line 265: Occasionally you’ll encounter a feature, such as posting autobiographical
Line 266: profiles in Table 11.1, that has high values for two responses. This indicates that
Line 267: different types of customers and users have different expectations. In these cases,
Line 268: you should consider analyzing responses based on some factor that differentiates
Line 269: your customer or user subpopulation. You may, for example, separate answers
Line 270: from users at small companies from users at large companies. Or you may
Line 271: choose to separate answers based on job role within a company or by industry
Line 272: segment.
Line 273: Relative Weighting: Another Approach
Line 274: Karl Wiegers (1999) has recommended an approach that is similar to Kano’s in
Line 275: that it considers both the positive benefit of the presence of a feature and the
Line 276: negative impact of its absence. Rather than use questionnaires, this approach re-
Line 277: lies on expert judgment. Collaboratively, but led by the product owner, the team
Line 278: assesses each feature being considered for the next release. Each feature is as-
Line 279: sessed in terms of the benefits it will bring if implemented, as well as the penalty
Line 280: that will be incurred if it is not implemented. As with estimates of story points
Line 281: and ideal time, the estimates of benefits and penalties are relative. A scale of 1 to
Line 282: 9 is used. Table 11.2, which again uses the SwimStats features, shows how this
Line 283: works.
Line 284: The benefit of including graphs of a swimmer’s event times over a season is
Line 285: estimated at 8. This feature is slightly less valuable than uploading photos but is
Line 286: much more valuable than the ability for swimmers to post autobiographical pro-
Line 287: files. As for the relative penalties if these features are absent, there is very little
Line 288: penalty if users cannot upload photos. (In Kano’s terms, uploading photos is
Line 289: probably an exciter—users would like it but would not reject the product if it
Line 290: were absent.) There is more of a penalty if event times cannot be graphed or
Line 291: autobiographies posted.

Line 330: Prioritizing Desirability
Line 331: For each feature, the relative benefit and penalty are summed and entered in
Line 332: the Total Value column. If you wish, you could weight the benefits and penalties.
Line 333: For example, to weight the relative benefit as twice as important as the relative
Line 334: penalty, multiply the Relative Benefit by 2 before adding it to Relative Penalty to
Line 335: get the Total Value. 
Line 336: The sum of the Total Value column (in this case, 33) represents the total
Line 337: value of delivering all features. To calculate the relative contribution of each fea-
Line 338: ture, divide its total value by the sum of the Total Value column. For example,
Line 339: graphing event times has a value of 14. The total value of all features is 33. Divid-
Line 340: ing 14 by 33 results in 0.42, or 42%. This means that graphing event times rep-
Line 341: resents 42% of the total value of all listed features. 
Line 342: The next column, Estimate, holds the story-point or ideal-days estimate. Ex-
Line 343: actly as with Total Value, the Estimate column is summed (61, in this case) and
Line 344: the percentage of each estimate is calculated in the Cost % column. In this ex-
Line 345: ample, graphing event times is estimated at 32 story points or ideal days. The
Line 346: three combined are 61 story points or ideal days. So graphing event times repre-
Line 347: sents 53% of the total cost of these three stories (
Line 348: ). 
Line 349: The final column, Priority, is calculated by dividing the Value % by the Cost
Line 350: %. Higher numbers represent higher priorities because they will create more
Line 351: value for the effort invested in them. You can see this in Table 11.2 by looking at
Line 352: the feature to post autobiographical profiles. This feature generates a little more
Line 353: than half the value of graphing event times (a Total Value of 8 compared with
Line 354: 14), but it does so at one-fourth the cost (an estimate of 8 compared with 32).
Line 355: Because of its high value-to-cost ratio, posting autobiographical profiles is the
Line 356: highest-priority feature in this analysis.

Line 406: Summary
Line 407: Let’s step back for a moment and remember why we’re doing this. In the previ-
Line 408: ous chapter, we learned that there are four factors to consider when prioritizing
Line 409: features.
Line 410: 1. The amount and significance of learning and new knowledge created by de-
Line 411: veloping the features.
Line 412: 2. The amount of risk removed by developing the features.
Line 413: 3. The financial value of having the features.
Line 414: 4. The cost of developing (and perhaps supporting) the new features.
Line 415: The previous chapter, “Prioritizing Themes,” described the importance of
Line 416: factoring learning and risk reduction into the overall prioritization of a feature.
Line 417: This chapter presented two approaches to prioritizing the desirability of fea-
Line 418: tures: Kano analysis and relative weighting. 
Line 419: In Kano analysis, features are segregated into must-have features, linear fea-
Line 420: tures, and exciters. This is done by asking potential users two questions about
Line 421: each feature: how they would feel if the feature were present and how they would
Line 422: feel if it were not present. 
Line 423: The Importance of Including Relative Penalty
Line 424: You may be tempted to drop the Relative Penalty column. Don’t. As with
Line 425: the Kano approach, it can be very useful to look at features from the per-
Line 426: spective of how users will be affected by the presence of the feature as
Line 427: well as by the absence of the feature.
Line 428: One of my clients in the financial services industry provides a good ex-
Line 429: ample of the importance of considering the relative penalty. The product
Line 430: owner for their team was able to prioritize most features quite easily.
Line 431: However, one feature she had to prioritize would bring no value to the
Line 432: company other than keeping the company in compliance with certain
Line 433: new government regulations. She joked that the only downside to not
Line 434: implementing the feature was that the CEO might spend some time in
Line 435: prison. And she (because she wasn’t the CEO) was OK with that risk if it
Line 436: meant getting other features into the product instead. 
Line 437: This is a clear example of a feature with a relative benefit of 1 but a
Line 438: relative penalty of 9.

Line 442: Chapter 11
Line 443: Prioritizing Desirability
Line 444: Relative weighting provides an approach to assessing the benefits of imple-
Line 445: menting a feature, the penalties of not implementing it, and the cost into a sin-
Line 446: gle value representing the priority of a feature.
Line 447: Discussion Questions
Line 448: 1. What are the relative merits of Kano analysis and relative weighting in your
Line 449: current organization?
Line 450: 2. What exciters are going into your current project?
Line 451: 3. Does your current project have the right mix of exciters, linear features, and
Line 452: must-have features?

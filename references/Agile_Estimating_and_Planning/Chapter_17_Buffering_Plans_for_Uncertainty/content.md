Line 6: Uncertainty
Line 7: “To be uncertain is to be uncomfortable,
Line 8: but to be certain is to be ridiculous.”
Line 9: —Chinese proverb
Line 10: One of the complaints I often hear about agile planning is that it doesn’t work
Line 11: well in some environments. Typically, the environments cited are ones in which:
Line 12: ◆The project is planned far in advance.
Line 13: ◆The project must meet a firm deadline and include a reasonably firm set of
Line 14: functionality.
Line 15: ◆The project is contracted from one organization to another.
Line 16: ◆Requirements are understood only at a very superficial level.
Line 17: ◆The organization is uncomfortable allowing too much flexibility in sched-
Line 18: ules, even on projects that don’t need firm deadlines and deliverables.
Line 19: Being able to create reliable plans in these environments is extremely im-
Line 20: portant. It is often not enough to use just the approach covered in the previous
Line 21: chapters. What projects in these environments have in common is that each
Line 22: comes with either an additional amount of uncertainty or with greater conse-
Line 23: quences to being wrong. For example, I was previously a vice president of soft-
Line 24: ware development at a Fortune 40 company, and our projects were typically
Line 25: scheduled onto the calendar twelve to eighteen months in advance, when we’d
Line 26: start setting the following year’s budget. We certainly didn’t lock down

Line 30: Chapter 17
Line 31: Buffering Plans for Uncertainty
Line 32: requirements, but we would establish the nature of the products we would be
Line 33: building. Even though requirements were only vaguely understood, we had to
Line 34: make first-level commitments that would allow us to staff the organization ap-
Line 35: propriately. There was further uncertainty because I rarely knew who from my
Line 36: team would work on projects that far in advance. Often, they had not even been
Line 37: hired yet. 
Line 38: Compare this situation with a project on which you are required to state a
Line 39: firm deadline and commit to a core set of functionality. Missing the deadline, or
Line 40: delivering much less functionality, will damage your company’s reputation in
Line 41: the industry and your reputation within the company. Even if you have a reason-
Line 42: able understanding of the requirements and know who will compose the team
Line 43: (unlike in my case above), the risk of being wrong is significant.
Line 44: In these cases, there is either greater uncertainty or greater implication to
Line 45: being wrong about a release schedule. Because of this, it is useful to include a
Line 46: buffer in the determination of the schedule. A buffer is a margin for error around
Line 47: an estimate. In cases where there is significant uncertainty or the cost of being
Line 48: wrong is significant, including a buffer is wise. The buffer helps protect the
Line 49: project against the impact of the uncertainty. In this way, buffering a project
Line 50: schedule becomes an appropriate risk management strategy. In this chapter,
Line 51: we’ll look at two types of buffers: feature buffers and schedule buffers.
Line 52: Feature Buffers
Line 53: I went to the grocery store last night with a list of thirty-seven items to get. I had
Line 54: only thirty minutes to shop and drive home because I wanted to watch a basket-
Line 55: ball game that was scheduled to start at that time. As always, I started at one end
Line 56: of the store and worked my way to the other. But as I went down each aisle, I was
Line 57: mostly focused on the twenty or so items that I knew we needed most. If I came
Line 58: home without milk, bread, or sliced turkey, I knew I’d be in trouble, and at half-
Line 59: time I’d be back at the store. But if I forgot items of lesser importance, my wife
Line 60: would be content, my daughters could eat, and I could watch the basketball
Line 61: game.
Line 62: Buffering a project with features is exactly the same. We tell our customers,
Line 63: “We’ll get you all of the functionality in this pile and ideally some of the func-
Line 64: tionality in that pile.” Creating a feature buffer is simple to do on an agile
Line 65: project. First, the customer selects all of the absolutely mandatory work. The es-
Line 66: timates for that work are summed. This represents the minimum that can be re-
Line 67: leased. The customer then selects another 25% to 40% more work, selecting
Line 68: toward the higher end of the range for projects with more uncertainty or less
Line 69: 
Line 70: --- 페이지 220 ---
Line 71: Schedule Buffers 
Line 72: |
Line 73: 189
Line 74: tolerance for schedule risk. The estimates for this work are added to the original
Line 75: estimate, resulting in a total estimate for the project. The project is then planned
Line 76: as normal for delivery of the entire set of functionality; however, some amount of
Line 77: the work is optional and will be included only if time permits. The optional work
Line 78: is developed last, only after the mandatory work is complete.
Line 79: To see how this works, assume that the product owner identifies 100 story
Line 80: points as mandatory. Each story selected is required to release a product that will
Line 81: be favorably accepted by the market. The product owner then selects an addi-
Line 82: tional 30% more work, identifying user stories worth an additional 30 story
Line 83: points. These are added as optional work to the project. The total project is now
Line 84: expected to be 130 story points. Using the techniques described in Chapter 16,
Line 85: “Estimating Velocity,” the team estimates velocity will be ten points per one-
Line 86: week iteration. The project is then planned to take thirteen iterations (130/10). If
Line 87: all goes well, the mandatory work will be done after the first ten iterations, and
Line 88: the remaining three will be spent on the optional features.
Line 89: This feature buffering process is consistent with that used in the agile pro-
Line 90: cess, DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method). On DSDM projects, re-
Line 91: quirements are sorted into four categories: Must Have, Should Have, Could
Line 92: Have, and Won’t Have. DSDM refers to this sorting as the MoSCoW rules. No
Line 93: more than 70% of the planned effort for a project can be targeted at Must Have
Line 94: requirements. In this way, DSDM projects create a feature buffer equivalent to
Line 95: 30% of the duration of the project.
Line 96: Schedule Buffers
Line 97: Suppose I need to go to the airport and catch a flight to Italy. (As long as I’m sup-
Line 98: posing, I might as well suppose I need to go somewhere nice.) An airplane flight
Line 99: has a very firm deadline. The flight will take off with or without me. In creating
Line 100: a plan for getting from my house to the proper gate at the airport, I need to leave
Line 101: early enough that I’m reasonably confident I’ll make my flight, but not so early
Line 102: that I’m at the airport three days ahead.
Line 103: I think about all of the steps involved: driving to the airport, parking my car,
Line 104: checking in and dropping off my luggage, and going through the security check-
Line 105: point. I think about how long that should take me if everything goes well and de-
Line 106: cide it should take seventy minutes. That’s how long it should take. It may take
Line 107: even a few minutes less, but it could take a whole lot longer. If there’s an acci-
Line 108: dent on the highway, and if the parking lot is full, and if there’s a long line to
Line 109: check in, and if there’s a long line to go through security, it could take quite a
Line 110: while longer. I don’t need to plan on all of these things going wrong on the same
Line 111:

Line 114: Chapter 17
Line 115: Buffering Plans for Uncertainty
Line 116: trip; but because this is an important trip, and I don’t want to miss my flight, I
Line 117: should add some extra time to the seventy minutes it should take if everything
Line 118: goes well.
Line 119: Let’s say I decide to leave for the airport 100 minutes before my flight. If
Line 120: things go well, that will leave me thirty minutes to pass in the airport, which
Line 121: isn’t bad. If things go really well (all the traffic lights are green, I park in the
Line 122: front row, no one is ahead of me to check in or at security) then maybe I have
Line 123: forty minutes in the airport. But if I get stuck in traffic or in a big line to check
Line 124: in, this extra time will most likely be enough to get me on the plane before it
Line 125: leaves. The extra thirty minutes are my schedule buffer; they protect the on-time
Line 126: completion of the overall project (getting to the airport).
Line 127: For a trip to the airport, it is not appropriate to take a guess at my rate of
Line 128: progress (my velocity) and then provide the airline (the customer) with periodic
Line 129: updates about my expected arrival time. My expected arrival time and my rate of
Line 130: progress don’t matter to the airline; the departure time is fixed, just like dead-
Line 131: lines are on many software development projects. In this cases, a schedule buffer
Line 132: protects against uncertainty that can affect the on-time completion of the
Line 133: project.
Line 134: Note that I am not concerned with whether any one activity (driving, park-
Line 135: ing, checking in, or going through security) takes too long. I am concerned only
Line 136: with whether the overall chain of activities takes too long. To make my flight, I
Line 137: add a thirty-minute buffer to my overall schedule for getting to the airport. What
Line 138: we’d like to do is add a similar schedule buffer to projects with greater uncer-
Line 139: tainty or with greater consequences for missing a deadline.
Line 140: Reflecting Uncertainty in Estimates
Line 141: To protect a project schedule against uncertainty, we need a way to quantify the
Line 142: uncertainty. When we estimate and assign a single value to a user story, we pre-
Line 143: tend that a single number reflects our expectations about the amount of time de-
Line 144: veloping the feature will take. More realistically, though, we know the work may
Line 145: be completed within a range of durations. A team may estimate a particular user
Line 146: story as three ideal days, knowing that three ideal days typically represents four
Line 147: or five elapsed days of work. If the story takes six days to complete, however, no
Line 148: one will be shocked; things sometimes take longer than planned. If we graph the
Line 149: possible completion times for a task, it will look approximately like Figure 17.1.
Line 150: The curve takes on this general shape because there normally is not much
Line 151: that can be done to accelerate the completion of a task, but there are an indefi-
Line 152: nite number of things that can go wrong and delay the completion of a task. For

Line 158: example, just as I’m about to finish coding a particular new feature, my com-
Line 159: puter crashes, and I lose unsaved changes. Then lightning hits the building and
Line 160: fries our source repository. We request a backup tape to be delivered tomorrow
Line 161: morning, but the delivery service loses the tape. But I don’t care, as I’m run over
Line 162: by the proverbial bus on the way to work.
Line 163: Figure 17.1 The distribution of completion times.
Line 164: The single most likely completion time in Figure 17.1 is where the line
Line 165: peaks. Overall, however, finishing by that time is less than 50% likely. We know
Line 166: this because less than 50% of the area under the curve is to the left of the peak.
Line 167: If a developer were to provide an estimate corresponding to the peak of
Line 168: Figure 17.1, she would most likely take longer than that estimate to finish the
Line 169: work. A more useful way of visualizing this is in Figure 17.2, which shows the
Line 170: cumulative probability of finishing on or before the times on the horizontal axis.
Line 171: Whereas Figure 17.1 shows the probability of finishing at a specific time,
Line 172: Figure 17.2 shows the probability of finishing at or before that time. When esti-
Line 173: mating and planning, this is more important to us than the probability of finish-
Line 174: ing on any one day (as shown in Figure 17.1).

Line 182: Figure 17.2 The cumulative distribution of completion times.
Line 183: Another way to think about Figure 17.2 and cumulative probability of com-
Line 184: pletion times is to assume that 100 different but equally skilled and experienced
Line 185: programmers independently develop a new feature. By what date would each fin-
Line 186: ish? The results might be similar to those shown in Table 17.1. This table shows

Line 188: ished by a given date.
Line 189: Suppose we want to be 90% confident in the schedule we commit to. One

Line 225: schedule buffer works, let’s again consider my trip to the airport, a possible
Line 226: schedule for which is shown in Figure 17.3.
Line 227: Figure 17.3 The 50% and 90% estimates for making a flight at the airport.
Line 228: The first number for each task (in the clear box) is the 50% estimate of how
Line 229: long the task should take. I expect tasks to take longer half the time and shorter
Line 230: half the time. The second number (in the shaded box) is the additional amount
Line 231: of time to reach my 90% estimate. The additional time between the 50% and the
Line 232: 90% estimate is called local safety. We often add local safety to an estimate we
Line 233: want to be more confident of meeting. In this case, I think I can find my keys in
Line 234: one to six minutes. I can drive to the airport in forty-five to seventy-five minutes,
Line 235: and so on.
Line 236: Adding up the 50% numbers gives me an expected duration of an hour and
Line 237: ten minutes. However, if I leave my house that close to departure time, the
Line 238: slightest delay will cause me to miss my flight. On the other end, adding up the
Line 239: 90% estimates gives a total of 2:50. I don’t want to leave nearly three hours
Line 240: ahead of my flight, because there’s very little chance that everything will go
Line 241: wrong. What I really want is a project plan that looks like Figure 17.4.
Line 242: The plan in Figure 17.4 is built using the 50% estimates and then adding a
Line 243: project buffer. This type of plan makes much more sense than one built entirely
Line 244: from summing the 50% or the 90% estimates. The plan in Figure 17.4 protects
Line 245: the only deadline that matters: the overall project deadline. Because it isn’t im-
Line 246: portant if any one task on my way to the airport finishes late, I do not need to
Line 247: buffer the on-time completion of the tasks. This allows me to construct a

Line 271: Buffering Plans for Uncertainty
Line 272: schedule that removes local safety from the individual tasks and puts a fraction
Line 273: of that time into a buffer that protects the overall schedule. Notice that the buff-
Line 274: ered schedule of Figure 17.4 is only 1:58—nearly an hour shorter than the
Line 275: schedule created by summing the 90% estimates.
Line 276: Figure 17.4 A buffered trip to the airport.
Line 277: Even better, by moving local safety into an overall project buffer, we are able
Line 278: to avoid the impact of Parkinson’s Law and student syndrome. As you’ll recall
Line 279: from Chapter 2, “Why Planning Fails,” Parkinson’s Law says that work expands
Line 280: to fill the time available. Student syndrome (Goldratt 1997) refers to starting
Line 281: something at the last possible moment that doesn’t preclude successful comple-
Line 282: tion—for example, starting a college term paper three days before it’s due. Be-
Line 283: cause it averts the problems caused by Parkinson’s Law and student syndrome, a
Line 284: shorter schedule that includes a schedule buffer is more likely to be met than is
Line 285: a longer schedule. 
Line 286: To create a schedule buffer for a software project, the first thing we need to
Line 287: do is revise our estimating process so that it generates two estimates for each
Line 288: user story or feature. Just like with the trip to the airport, we need to know the
Line 289: 50% and the 90% estimate for each. This is easy enough: When the team meets
Line 290: to estimate, start by estimating the 50% case for the first story. Then estimate
Line 291: the 90% case for that story before moving on to the next story or feature.
Line 292: Sizing the Project Buffer
Line 293: The project buffer in Figure 17.4 was sized to be fifty-three minutes. How did I
Line 294: come up with that duration? It was based on the 50% and 90% estimates for that
Line 295: Total time = 1:58

Line 312: 195
Line 313: project, as shown in Figure 17.4. The beauty of associating two estimates with
Line 314: each user story is that the numbers very clearly point out the degree of schedule
Line 315: risk associated with each item. For example, if one story is estimated as being
Line 316: three to five and another story is estimated as being three to ten, we know that
Line 317: the second story brings more schedule risk to the project. The project buffer will
Line 318: be sized to accommodate the amount of schedule risk brought by the work
Line 319: planned in the project. Think about an extreme example: If you are planning a
Line 320: project schedule, you will need a smaller project buffer for tasks estimated to be
Line 321: 3 to 7 than you will for tasks estimated to be 3 to 100. Clearly, if the project has
Line 322: some 3-point tasks that could turn into 100-point tasks, the project buffer needs
Line 323: to be larger than if the worst case for those tasks were 10 points. So the spread
Line 324: between the 50% and 90% estimates influences the size of the project buffer.1
Line 325: Because our estimates are at the 50% and 90% points for each item, this
Line 326: means that the difference between these two estimates is about two standard de-
Line 327: viations. The standard deviation for each item is then 
Line 328: , where 
Line 329:  rep-
Line 330: resents the worst case (90% estimate) for story i and 
Line 331:  represents the average
Line 332: case (50% estimate) for the same story. We’d like the project buffer to protect the
Line 333: overall project to the same 90% level that each task was protected by its own
Line 334: 90% estimate. This means our project buffer should be two standard deviations
Line 335: and can be determined from this formula:
Line 336: where 
Line 337:  is the standard deviation. This can be simplifed to the following:
Line 338: Let’s see how we use this formula to determine the size of the schedule
Line 339: buffer. Suppose our project includes the six user stories shown in Table 17.2 and
Line 340: that each story has the 50% and 90% estimates shown. These estimates can be in
Line 341: story points or ideal days. The final column of Table 17.2 is calculated by taking
Line 342: the worst-case (90%) estimate of a story, subtracting the average case (50%) of
Line 343: that story, and squaring the result. The first story, for example, is 
Line 344: .
Line 345: The schedule buffer is the square root of the sum of these squares.2 In this case,
Line 346: the schedule buffer equals the square root of 90, which is 9.4, so we’ll round it to
Line 347: 1.
Line 348: Sizing a buffer in this way has been previously suggested by Reinertsen (1997),
Line 349: Newbold (1998), and Leach (2000).

Line 454: buffer, or 
Line 455:  in this case.
Line 456: Intuitively, the buffer calculated in Table 17.2 makes sense. The user story
Line 457: that contributes the most to the size of the schedule buffer (the first story) is the
Line 458: one with the most uncertainty (an eight-point difference between its 50% and

Line 461: Adding in a schedule buffer may or may not add one or more iterations to

Line 516: the full project is twenty-six points and will take three iterations to complete if
Line 517: their velocity is nine.
Line 518: A Simpler Buffer Calculation
Line 519: The preceding approach to sizing the project buffer is the best way to size the
Line 520: project buffer. But if for some reason you cannot come up with both 50% and
Line 521: 90% estimates, there is a simpler way to size the project buffer. Estimate each
Line 522: story at the 50% level and then set the buffer at half the size of the sum of the
Line 523: 50% estimates. Be sure that the entire team is aware that their estimates are to
Line 524: be ones they are 50% confident in. We want estimates that are just as likely to be
Line 525: high as they are to be low.
Line 526: Although this calculation is far simpler, it has the serious flaw of not being
Line 527: influenced by the actual uncertainty around the specific user stories in the
Line 528: project. Suppose there are two stories, each estimated at five story points. Each
Line 529: of these stories will contribute the same amount to the project buffer (half of
Line 530: their size, or 2.5 points each). This will be true even if one of the stories would
Line 531: have had a 90% estimate of 100 and the other a 90% estimate of 10. 
Line 532: For these reasons, and because it’s extremely easy just to ask for two esti-
Line 533: mates at the time you’re estimating, I prefer the approach based on the square
Line 534: root of the sum of the squares.
Line 535: Buffer Guidelines
Line 536: Regardless of whether you prefer to take the square root of the sum of the
Line 537: squares approach or the 50% approach, you should consider these additional
Line 538: guidelines based on advice from Leach (2000).
Line 539: ◆The square root of the sum of the squares approach is most reliable if there
Line 540: are at least ten user stories or features being estimated. But if your project
Line 541: has fewer than ten items, you probably shouldn’t be planning with a buffer
Line 542: anyway.
Line 543: ◆The project buffer should represent at least 20% of the total project dura-
Line 544: tion. A smaller buffer may not provide adequate protection for the overall
Line 545: project.

Line 550: Buffering Plans for Uncertainty
Line 551: Combining Buffers
Line 552: At first, it may seem like overkill to have multiple buffers. However, it is often ap-
Line 553: propriate to use multiple buffers, because we are protecting the project against
Line 554: multiple types of uncertainty. My car has shoulder belts and air bags because
Line 555: each buffers me against a different type of collision. We should always buffer a
Line 556: given type of project uncertainty with the right units, which means we buffer
Line 557: feature uncertainty with features and schedule uncertainty with time. Addition-
Line 558: ally, when multiple buffers are used, the size of each can be smaller. 
Line 559: It is when we combine feature and schedule buffers on a project that projects
Line 560: become truly protected against uncertainty. Consider the three projects shown
Line 561: in Figure 17.5. In this figure, (a) shows a project that must deliver a defined set
Line 562: of functionality but allows the schedule to vary. Figure 17.5(b) shows the oppo-
Line 563: site: a project whose date is fixed but has complete flexibility around the func-
Line 564: tionality to be built. Now look at Figure 17.5(c), and see that by including both a
Line 565: feature buffer and a schedule buffer the team is able to commit to both a delivery
Line 566: date and a minimum set of features. When creating a release plan, our goal is to
Line 567: use buffers so that the team can make these types of commitments.
Line 568: Figure 17.5 Three projects with different approaches to buffering.
Line 569: Also, keep in mind that a project may use other buffers besides feature and
Line 570: schedule. A project may include a budget buffer where, for example, thirty devel-
Line 571: opers are assigned to the project, whereas the budget allows up to thirty-three.
Line 572: This is a common practice on medium and large projects but is seen less fre-
Line 573: quently on small projects for two reasons.
Line 574: 1. The additional person or two who would make up the personnel buffer on a
Line 575: small project would almost certainly be able to make direct contributions to
Line 576: the project. There may be little or no productivity gains in fully staffing from

Line 599: thirty to thirty-three developers. There will, however, almost certainly be
Line 600: productivity gains from fully staffing from four to five.
Line 601: 2. It is difficult to buffer anything in small numbers. When a thirty-person
Line 602: project has a three-person buffer to a full staff size of thirty-three, it has a
Line 603: 10% personnel buffer. A similar buffer on a three-person project implies a
Line 604: buffer of three-tenths of a developer. Clearly, it’s easier to add whole rather
Line 605: than partial people to a project.
Line 606: A Schedule Buffer Is Not Padding
Line 607: The term padding has the pejorative meaning of excess time arbitrarily added to
Line 608: an estimate. I pad an estimate when I think it will take three days but decide to
Line 609: tell you five, just in case. Individuals add padding to an estimate if they expect to
Line 610: be beaten up if they are wrong. A schedule buffer is different: A schedule buffer is
Line 611: a necessary margin of safety added to the sum of estimates from which local
Line 612: safety has been removed. 
Line 613: When you put five car lengths between your car and the one ahead, you do
Line 614: that because you fully expect to use up most of that buffer if forced to brake sud-
Line 615: denly. Yes, it’s possible you could drive for hours with one car length separating
Line 616: you and the car ahead, but it’s not likely. The buffer around your car is critical to
Line 617: your safety. Appropriate buffers around your project are critical to the safety of
Line 618: your project.
Line 619: When we allow small amounts of flexibility in both delivery date and func-
Line 620: tionality, we can buffer two dimensions of the project. More important, we buffer
Line 621: each project constraint with the appropriate resource: We buffer the deadline
Line 622: with time; we buffer functionality with functionality. When we cannot buffer a
Line 623: constraint appropriately, we are forced to increase the size of other buffers. If I
Line 624: am forced to guarantee the functionality, I will support that guarantee with a
Line 625: larger schedule buffer.
Line 626: Some Caveats
Line 627: Although knowing how to add one or more buffers to a project is an important
Line 628: skill to have at your disposal, it is also good to be aware of some caveats on their
Line 629: use.
Line 630: ◆When adding a schedule buffer, use the two-estimate approach described in
Line 631: this chapter or be sure that the single-value estimates represent estimates at
Line 632: 
Line 633: --- 페이지 231 ---
Line 634: 200 |
Line 635: Chapter 17
Line 636: Buffering Plans for Uncertainty
Line 637: the 50% point. Adding a schedule buffer on top of already pessimistic 90%
Line 638: estimates will result in an overly long schedule.
Line 639: ◆On many projects, a precise deadline with a precise set of delivered function-
Line 640: ality is not needed. Instead, the team simply needs to deliver high-quality
Line 641: software as fast as possible over a sustained period. If you’re in this situation,
Line 642: don’t take on the extra work of adding buffers to your project.
Line 643: ◆Be careful with how you communicate buffers. You should not hide their ex-
Line 644: istence or how they are used. However, a buffer (especially a schedule buffer)
Line 645: can appear to be padding. This means you’ll need to communicate how you
Line 646: derived the estimates and the buffer, and how the buffer is intended to pro-
Line 647: vide a schedule everyone can be highly confident of. 
Line 648: Summary
Line 649: Most projects contain a tremendous amount of uncertainty. This uncertainty is
Line 650: often not fully reflected in the schedules and deadlines that project teams create.
Line 651: There are times when this uncertainty is so large or signficant that extra steps
Line 652: should be taken when estimating the duration of the project. This may be the
Line 653: case when the project is planned far in advance, the project must absolutely
Line 654: meet a deadline with a reasonably firm set of functionality, the project is out-
Line 655: sourced, requirements are still at a superficial level, or there is a significant im-
Line 656: pact (financial or otherwise) to being wrong about a date.
Line 657: The two most common types of buffers are feature buffers and schedule buff-
Line 658: ers. A feature buffer is created when a product’s requirements are prioritized and
Line 659: it is acknowledged that not every feature may be delivered. The agile process
Line 660: DSDM, for example, recommends that 30% of the effort of the project be consid-
Line 661: ered optional, which creates a feature buffer for the project. If time runs short,
Line 662: the schedule can still be met by dropping items in the feature buffer.
Line 663: A schedule buffer, on the other hand, is created by including in the schedule
Line 664: an amount of time that reflects the uncertainty inherent in a team’s size. A fea-
Line 665: ture buffer can be constructed by estimating both a 50% likely size and a 90%
Line 666: likely size for each user story. By applying the square root of the sum of the
Line 667: squares formula to each of the 50% and 90% estimates, an appropriately sized
Line 668: schedule buffer can be estimated. 
Line 669: A project should protect against feature uncertainty with a feature buffer
Line 670: and againt schedule uncertainty with a schedule buffer. A feature buffer may be
Line 671: combined with a schedule buffer. In fact, this is usually a good idea, as it allows
Line 672: the size of each to be smaller.

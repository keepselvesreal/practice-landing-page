Line16 It may not look like much, but it conﬁrms that a Sniper can establish a
Line17 connection with an auction, accept a response, and display the result.
Line18 The Necessary Minimum
Line19 In one of his school reports, Steve was noted as “a ﬁne judge of the necessary
Line20 minimum.” It seems he’s found his calling in writing software since this is a
Line21 critical skill during iteration zero.
Line22 What we hope you’ve seen in this chapter is the degree of focus that’s required
Line23 to put together your ﬁrst walking skeleton. The point is to design and validate
Line24 the initial structure of the end-to-end system—where end-to-end includes deploy-
Line25 ment to a working environment—to prove that our choices of packages, libraries,
Line26 and tooling will actually work. A sense of urgency will help the team to strip the
Line27 functionality down to the absolute minimum sufﬁcient to test their assumptions.
Line28 That’s why we didn’t put any content in our Sniper messages; it would be a di-
Line29 version from making sure that the communication and event handling work. We
Line30 didn’t sweat too hard over the detailed code design, partly because there isn’t
Line31 much but mainly because we’re just getting the pieces in place; that effort will
Line32 come soon enough.
Line33 Of course, all you see in this chapter are edited highlights. We’ve left out many
Line34 diversions and discussions as we ﬁgured out which pieces to use and how to make
Line35 them work, trawling through product documentation and discussion lists. We’ve
Line36 also left out some of our discussions about what this project is for. Iteration zero
Line37 usually brings up project chartering issues as the team looks for criteria to guide
Line38 its decisions, so the project’s sponsors should expect to ﬁeld some deep questions
Line39 about its purpose.

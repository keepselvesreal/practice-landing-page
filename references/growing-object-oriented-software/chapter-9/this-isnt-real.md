Line6 We don’t know if this is exactly the order of steps we’ll take, but we believe
Line7 we need all of this, and we can adjust as we go along. To keep ourselves
Line8 focused, we’ve written the plan on an index card, as in Figure 9.4.
Line9 This Isn’t Real
Line10 By now you may be raising objections about all the practicalities we’ve skipped
Line11 over. We saw them too. We’ve taken shortcuts with the process and design to
Line12 give you a feel of how a real project works while remaining within the limits of
Line13 a book. In particular:
Line14 •
Line15 This isn’t a realistic architecture: XMPP is neither reliable nor secure, and
Line16 so is unsuitable for transactions. Ensuring any of those qualities is outside
Line17 our scope. That said, the fundamental techniques that we describe still apply
Line18 whatever the underlying architecture may be. (In our defense, we see that
Line19 major systems have been built on a protocol as inappropriate as HTTP, so
Line20 perhaps we’re not as unrealistic as we fear.)
Line21 •
Line22 This isn’t Agile Planning: We rushed through the planning of the project
Line23 to produce a single to-do list. In a real project, we’d likely have a view of
Line24 the whole deliverable (a release plan) before jumping in. There are good
Line25 descriptions of how to do agile planning in other books, such as [Shore07]
Line26 and [Cohn05].

Line28 This isn’t realistic usability design: Good user experience design investigates
Line29 what the end user is really trying to achieve and uses that to create a con-
Line30 sistent experience. The User Experience community has been engaging with
Line31 the Agile Development community for some time on how to do this itera-
Line32 tively. This project is simple enough that we can draft a vision of what we
Line33 want to achieve and work towards it.

Cycle
We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action
always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action.

Introduction
The TDD process we described in Chapter 1 assumes that we can grow the system
by just slotting the tests for new features into an existing infrastructure. But what
about the very ﬁrst feature, before we have this infrastructure? As an acceptance
test, it must run end-to-end to give us the feedback we need about the system’s
external interfaces, which means we must have implemented a whole automated
build, deploy, and test cycle. This is a lot of work to do before we can even see
our ﬁrst test fail.
Deploying and testing right from the start of a project forces the team to un-
derstand how their system ﬁts into the world. It ﬂushes out the “unknown
unknown” technical and organizational risks so they can be addressed while
there’s still time. Attempting to deploy also helps the team understand who they
need to liaise with, such as system administrators or external vendors, and start
to build those relationships.
Starting with “build, deploy, and test” on a nonexistent system sounds odd,
but we think it’s essential. The risks of leaving it to later are just too high. We
have seen projects canceled after months of development because they could not
reliably deploy their system. We have seen systems discarded because new features
required months of manual regression testing and even then the error rates were
too high. As always, we view feedback as a fundamental tool, and we want to
know as early as possible whether we’re moving in the right direction. Then,
once we have our ﬁrst test in place, subsequent tests will be much quicker to write.

First, Test a Walking Skeleton
The quandary in writing and passing the ﬁrst acceptance test is that it’s hard to
build both the tooling and the feature it’s testing at the same time. Changes in
one disrupt any progress made with the other, and tracking down failures is
tricky when the architecture, the tests, and the production code are all moving.
One of the symptoms of an unstable development environment is that there’s no
obvious ﬁrst place to look when something fails.
We can cut through this “ﬁrst-feature paradox” by splitting it into two smaller
problems. First, work out how to build, deploy, and test a “walking skeleton,”
then use that infrastructure to write the acceptance tests for the ﬁrst meaningful
feature. After that, everything will be in place for test-driven development of the
rest of the system.
A “walking skeleton” is an implementation of the thinnest possible slice of
real functionality that we can automatically build, deploy, and test end-to-end
[Cockburn04]. It should include just enough of the automation, the major com-
ponents, and communication mechanisms to allow us to start working on the
ﬁrst feature. We keep the skeleton’s application functionality so simple that it’s
obvious and uninteresting, leaving us free to concentrate on the infrastructure.
For example, for a database-backed web application, a skeleton would show a
ﬂat web page with ﬁelds from the database. In Chapter 10, we’ll show an example
that displays a single value in the user interface and sends just a handshake
message to the server.
It’s also important to realize that the “end” in “end-to-end” refers to the pro-
cess, as well as the system. We want our test to start from scratch, build a deploy-
able system, deploy it into a production-like environment, and then run the tests
through the deployed system. Including the deployment step in the testing process
is critical for two reasons. First, this is the sort of error-prone activity that should
not be done by hand, so we want our scripts to have been thoroughly exercised
by the time we have to deploy for real. One lesson that we’ve learned repeatedly
is that nothing forces us to understand a process better than trying to automate
it. Second, this is often the moment where the development team bumps into the
rest of the organization and has to learn how it operates. If it’s going to take six
weeks and four signatures to set up a database, we want to know now, not
two weeks before delivery.
In practice, of course, real end-to-end testing may be so hard to achieve that
we have to start with infrastructure that implements our current understanding
of what the real system will do and what its environment is. We keep in mind,
however, that this is a stop-gap, a temporary patch until we can ﬁnish the job,
and that unknown risks remain until our tests really run end-to-end. One of the
weaknesses of our Auction Sniper example (Part III) is that the tests run against

a dummy server, not the real site. At some point before going live, we would
have had to test against Southabee’s On-Line; the earlier we can do that, the
easier it will be for us to respond to any surprises that turn up.
Whilst building the “walking skeleton,” we concentrate on the structure and
don’t worry too much about cleaning up the test to be beautifully expressive.
The walking skeleton and its supporting infrastructure are there to help us work
out how to start test-driven development. It’s only the ﬁrst step toward a complete
end-to-end acceptance-testing solution. When we write the test for the ﬁrst feature,
then we need to “write the test you want to read” (page 42) to make sure that
it’s a clear expression of the behavior of the system.
The Importance of Early End-to-End Testing
We joined a project that had been running for a couple of years but had never
tested their entire system end-to-end. There were frequent production outages
and deployments often failed. The system was large and complex, reﬂecting the
complicated business transactions it managed.The effort of building an automated,
end-to-end test suite was so large that an entire new team had to be formed to
perform the work. It took them months to build an end-to-end test environment,
and they never managed to get the entire system covered by an end-to-end
test suite.
Because the need for end-to-end testing had not inﬂuenced its design, the system
was difﬁcult to test. For example, the system’s components used internal timers
to schedule activities, some of them days or weeks into the future. This made it
very difﬁcult to write end-to-end tests: It was impractical to run the tests in real-
time but the scheduling could not be inﬂuenced from outside the system. The
developers had to redesign the system itself so that periodic activities were trig-
gered by messages sent from a remote scheduler which could be replaced in the
test environment; see “Externalize Event Sources” (page 326).This was a signiﬁ-
cant architectural change—and it was very risky because it had to be performed
without end-to-end test coverage.
Deciding the Shape of the Walking Skeleton
The development of a “walking skeleton” is the moment when we start to make
choices about the high-level structure of our application. We can’t automate the
build, deploy, and test cycle without some idea of the overall structure. We don’t
need much detail yet, just a broad-brush picture of what major system components
will be needed to support the ﬁrst planned release and how they will communicate.
Our rule of thumb is that we should be able to draw the design for the “walking
skeleton” in a few minutes on a whiteboard.

Mappa Mundi
We ﬁnd that maintaining a public drawing of the structure of the system, for example
on the wall in the team’s work area as in Figure 4.1, helps the team stay oriented
when working on the code.

wall of a team’s work area
To design this initial structure, we have to have some understanding of the
purpose of the system, otherwise the whole exercise risks being meaningless. We
need a high-level view of the client’s requirements, both functional and non-
functional, to guide our choices. This preparatory work is part of the chartering
of the project, which we must leave as outside the scope of this book.
The point of the “walking skeleton” is to use the writing of the ﬁrst test to
draw out the context of the project, to help the team map out the landscape of
their solution—the essential decisions that they must take before they can write
any code; Figure 4.2 shows how the TDD process we drew in Figure 1.2 ﬁts into
this context.

The context of the ﬁrst test
Please don’t confuse this with doing “Big Design Up Front” (BDUF) which
has such a bad reputation in the Agile Development community. We’re not trying
to elaborate the whole design down to classes and algorithms before we start
coding. Any ideas we have now are likely to be wrong, so we prefer to discover
those details as we grow the system. We’re making the smallest number of
decisions we can to kick-start the TDD cycle, to allow us to start learning and
improving from real feedback.
Build Sources of Feedback
We have no guarantees that the decisions we’ve taken about the design of our
application, or the assumptions on which they’re based, are right. We do the best
we can, but the only thing we can rely on is validating them as soon as possible
by building feedback into our process. The tools we build to implement the
“walking skeleton” are there to support this learning process. Of course, these
tools too will not be perfect, and we expect we will improve them incrementally
as we learn how well they support the team.
Our ideal situation is where the team releases regularly to a real production
system, as in Figure 4.3. This allows the system’s stakeholders to respond to how
well the system meets their needs, at the same time allowing us to judge its
implementation.

Build Sources of Feedback

**Page 36**

We use the automation of building and testing to give us feedback on qualities
of the system, such as how easily we can cut a version and deploy, how well the
design works, and how good the code is. The automated deployment helps us
release frequently to real users, which gives us feedback on how well we have
understood the domain and whether seeing the system in practice has changed
our customer’s priorities.
The great beneﬁt is that we will be able to make changes in response to what-
ever we learn, because writing everything test-ﬁrst means that we will have a
thorough set of regression tests. No tests are perfect, of course, but in practice
we’ve found that a substantial test suite allows us to make major changes safely.
Expose Uncertainty Early
All this effort means that teams are frequently surprised by the time it takes to
get a “walking skeleton” working, considering that it does hardly anything.
That’s because this ﬁrst step involves establishing a lot of infrastructure and
asking (and answering) many awkward questions. The time to implement the
ﬁrst few features will be unpredictable as the team discovers more about its re-
quirements and target environment. For a new team, this will be compounded
by the social stresses of learning how to work together.
Fred Tingey, a colleague, once observed that incremental development can be
disconcerting for teams and management who aren’t used to it because it front-
loads the stress in a project. Projects with late integration start calmly but gener-
ally turn difﬁcult towards the end as the team tries to pull the system together
for the ﬁrst time. Late integration is unpredictable because the team has to
assemble a great many moving parts with limited time and budget to ﬁx any
failures. The result is that experienced stakeholders react badly to the instability
at the start of an incremental project because they expect that the end of the
project will be much worse.
Our experience is that a well-run incremental development runs in the opposite
direction. It starts unsettled but then, after a few features have been implemented
and the project automation has been built up, settles in to a routine. As a project
approaches delivery, the end-game should be a steady production of functionality,
perhaps with a burst of activity before the ﬁrst release. All the mundane but
brittle tasks, such as deployment and upgrades, will have been automated so that
they “just work.” The contrast looks rather like Figure 4.4.
This aspect of test-driven development, like others, may appear counter-
intuitive, but we’ve always found it worth taking enough time to structure and
automate the basics of the system—or at least a ﬁrst cut. Of course, we don’t
want to spend the whole project setting up a perfect “walking skeleton,” so we
limit ourselves to whiteboard-level decisions and reserve the right to change our
mind when we have to. But the most important thing is to have a sense of direction
and a concrete implementation to test our assumptions.

still time, budget, and goodwill to address them.
Brownﬁeld Development
We don’t always have the luxury of building a new system from the ground up.
Many of our projects have started with an existing system that must be extended,
adapted, or replaced. In such cases, we can’t start by building a “walking skeleton”;
we have to work with what already exists, no matter how hostile its structure.
That said, the process of kick-starting TDD of an existing system is not fundamen-
tally different from applying it to a new system—although it may be orders of
magnitude more difﬁcult because of the technical baggage the system already
carries. Michael Feathers has written a whole book on the topic, [Feathers04].
It is risky to start reworking a system when there are no tests to detect regressions.
The safest way to start the TDD process is to automate the build and deploy pro-
cess, and then add end-to-end tests that cover the areas of the code we need to
change. With that protection, we can start to address internal quality issues with
more conﬁdence, refactoring the code and introducing unit tests as we add func-
tionality.
The easiest way to start building an end-to-end test infrastructure is with the sim-
plest path through the system that we can ﬁnd. Like a “walking skeleton,” this lets
us build up some supporting infrastructure before we tackle the harder problems
of testing more complicated functionality.

Maintaining the Test-Driven
Cycle
Every day you may make progress. Every step may be fruitful. Yet there
will stretch out before you an ever-lengthening, ever-ascending,
ever-improving path. You know you will never get to the end of the
journey. But this, so far from discouraging, only adds to the joy and
glory of the climb.

Introduction
Once we’ve kick-started the TDD process, we need to keep it running smoothly.
In this chapter we’ll show how a TDD process runs once started. The rest of the
book explores in some detail how we ensure it runs smoothly—how we write
tests as we build the system, how we use tests to get early feedback on internal
and external quality issues, and how we ensure that the tests continue to support
change and do not become an obstacle to further development.
Start Each Feature with an Acceptance Test
As we described in Chapter 1, we start work on a new feature by writing failing
acceptance tests that demonstrate that the system does not yet have the feature
we’re about to write and track our progress towards completion of the
feature (Figure 5.1).
We write the acceptance test using only terminology from the application’s
domain, not from the underlying technologies (such as databases or web servers).
This helps us understand what the system should do, without tying us to any of
our initial assumptions about the implementation or complicating the test with
technological details. This also shields our acceptance test suite from changes to
the system’s technical infrastructure. For example, if a third-party organization
changes the protocol used by their services from FTP and binary ﬁles to web
services and XML, we should not have to rework the tests for the system’s
application logic.
We ﬁnd that writing such a test before coding makes us clarify what we want
to achieve. The precision of expressing requirements in a form that can be auto-
matically checked helps us uncover implicit assumptions. The failing tests keep

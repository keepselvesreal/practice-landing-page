Chapter 6
Object-Oriented Style
Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger
context—a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an
environment, an environment in a city plan.
—Eliel Saarinen
Introduction
So far in Part II, we’ve talked about how to get started with the development
process and how to keep going. Now we want to take a more detailed look at
our design goals and our use of TDD, and in particular mock objects, to guide
the structure of our code.
We value code that is easy to maintain over code that is easy to write.1 Imple-
menting a feature in the most direct way can damage the maintainability of the
system, for example by making the code difﬁcult to understand or by introducing
hidden dependencies between components. Balancing immediate and longer-term
concerns is often tricky, but we’ve seen too many teams that can no longer deliver
because their system is too brittle.
In this chapter, we want to show something of what we’re trying to achieve
when we design software, and how that looks in an object-oriented language;
this is the “opinionated” part of our approach to software. In the next chapter,
we’ll look at the mechanics of how to guide code in this direction with TDD.
Designing for Maintainability
Following the process we described in Chapter 5, we grow our systems a slice of
functionality at a time. As the code scales up, the only way we can continue to
understand and maintain it is by structuring the functionality into objects, objects
into packages,2 packages into programs, and programs into systems. We use two
principal heuristics to guide this structuring:
1. As the Agile Manifesto might have put it.
2. We’re being vague about the meaning of “package” here since we want it to include
concepts such as modules, libraries, and namespaces, which tend to be confounded
in the Java world—but you know what we mean.

Separation of concerns
When we have to change the behavior of a system, we want to change as
little code as possible. If all the relevant changes are in one area of code, we
don’t have to hunt around the system to get the job done. Because we cannot
predict when we will have to change any particular part of the system, we
gather together code that will change for the same reason. For example, code
to unpack messages from an Internet standard protocol will not change for
the same reasons as business code that interprets those messages, so we
partition the two concepts into different packages.
Higher levels of abstraction
The only way for humans to deal with complexity is to avoid it, by working
at higher levels of abstraction. We can get more done if we program by
combining components of useful functionality rather than manipulating
variables and control ﬂow; that’s why most people order food from a menu
in terms of dishes, rather than detail the recipes used to create them.
Applied consistently, these two forces will push the structure of an appli-
cation towards something like Cockburn’s “ports and adapters” architecture
[Cockburn08], in which the code for the business domain is isolated from its
dependencies on technical infrastructure, such as databases and user interfaces.
We don’t want technical concepts to leak into the application model, so we write
interfaces to describe its relationships with the outside world in its terminology
(Cockburn’s ports). Then we write bridges between the application core and each
technical domain (Cockburn’s adapters). This is related to what Eric Evans calls
an “anticorruption layer” [Evans03].
The bridges implement the interfaces deﬁned by the application model and
map between application-level and technical-level objects (Figure 6.1). For exam-
ple, a bridge might map an order book object to SQL statements so that orders
are persisted in a database. To do so, it might query values from the application
object or use an object-relational tool like Hibernate3 to pull values out of objects
using Java reﬂection. We’ll show an example of refactoring to this architecture
in Chapter 17.
The next question is how to ﬁnd the facets in the behavior where the interfaces
should be, so that we can divide up the code cleanly. We have some second-level
heuristics to help us think about that.

Encapsulation and Information Hiding
We want to be careful with the distinction between “encapsulation” and “information
hiding.” The terms are often used interchangeably but actually refer to two separate,
and largely orthogonal, qualities:
Encapsulation
Ensures that the behavior of an object can only be affected through its API.
It lets us control how much a change to one object will impact other parts of
the system by ensuring that there are no unexpected dependencies between
unrelated components.
Information hiding
Conceals how an object implements its functionality behind the abstraction
of its API. It lets us work with higher abstractions by ignoring lower-level details
that are unrelated to the task at hand.
We’re most aware of encapsulation when we haven’t got it. When working with
badly encapsulated code, we spend too much time tracing what the potential
effects of a change might be, looking at where objects are created, what common
data they hold, and where their contents are referenced. The topic has inspired
two books that we know of, [Feathers04] and [Demeyer03].

Designing for Maintainability

**Page 50**

Many object-oriented languages support encapsulation by providing control over
the visibility of an object’s features to other objects, but that’s not enough. Objects
can break encapsulation by sharing references to mutable objects, an effect known
as aliasing. Aliasing is essential for conventional object- oriented systems (other-
wise no two objects would be able to communicate), but accidental aliasing can
couple unrelated parts of a system so it behaves mysteriously and is inﬂexible to
change.
We follow standard practices to maintain encapsulation when coding: deﬁne
immutable value types, avoid global variables and singletons, copy collections
and mutable values when passing them between objects, and so on. We have
more about information hiding later in this chapter.
Internals vs. Peers
As we organize our system, we must decide what is inside and outside each object,
so that the object provides a coherent abstraction with a clear API. Much of the
point of an object, as we discussed above, is to encapsulate access to its internals
through its API and to hide these details from the rest of the system. An object
communicates with other objects in the system by sending and receiving messages,
as in Figure 6.2; the objects it communicates with directly are its peers.
Figure 6.2
Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages
This decision matters because it affects how easy an object is to use, and so
contributes to the internal quality of the system. If we expose too much of an
object’s internals through its API, its clients will end up doing some of its work.
We’ll have distributed behavior across too many objects (they’ll be coupled to-
gether), increasing the cost of maintenance because any changes will now ripple
across the code. This is the effect of the “train wreck” example on page 17:

((EditSaveCustomizer) master.getModelisable()
  .getDockablePanel()
    .getCustomizer())
      .getSaveItem().setEnabled(Boolean.FALSE.booleanValue());
Every getter in this example exposes a structural detail. If we wanted to change,
say, the way customizations on the master are enabled, we’d have to change all
the intermediate relationships.
Different Levels of Language
As you’ll see in Part III, we often write helper methods to make code more readable.
We’re not afraid of adding very small methods if they clarify the meaning of the
feature they represent. We name these methods to make the calling code read
as naturally as possible; we don’t have to conform to external conventions since
these methods are only there to support other code. For example, in Chapter 15
we have a line in a test that reads:
allowing(sniperListener).sniperStateChanged(with(aSniperThatIs(BIDDING)));
We’ll explain what this means at the time. What’s relevant here is that
aSniperThatIs() is a local method that constructs a value to be passed to the
with() method, and that its name is intended to describe its intent in this context.
In effect, we’re constructing a very small embedded language that deﬁnes, in this
case, a part of a test.
As well as distinguishing between value and object types (page 13), we ﬁnd that
we tend towards different programming styles at different levels in the code.
Loosely speaking, we use the message-passing style we’ve just described between
objects, but we tend to use a more functional style within an object, building up
behavior from methods and values that have no side effects.
Features without side effects mean that we can assemble our code from smaller
components, minimizing the amount of risky shared state. Writing large-scale
functional programs is a topic for a different book, but we ﬁnd that a little
immutability within the implementation of a class leads to much safer code and
that, if we do a good job, the code reads well too.
So how do we choose the right features for an object?
No And’s, Or’s, or But’s
Every object should have a single, clearly deﬁned responsibility; this is the “single
responsibility” principle [Martin02]. When we’re adding behavior to a system,
this principle helps us decide whether to extend an existing object or create a
new service for an object to call.

No And’s, Or’s, or But’s

**Page 52**

Our heuristic is that we should be able to describe what an object does without
using any conjunctions (“and,” “or”). If we ﬁnd ourselves adding clauses to the
description, then the object probably should be broken up into collaborating
objects, usually one for each clause.
This principle also applies when we’re combining objects into new abstractions.
If we’re packaging up behavior implemented across several objects into a single
construct, we should be able to describe its responsibility clearly; there are some
related ideas below in the “Composite Simpler Than the Sum of Its Parts” and
“Context Independence” sections.
Object Peer Stereotypes
We have objects with single responsibilities, communicating with their peers
through messages in clean APIs, but what do they say to each other?
We categorize an object’s peers (loosely) into three types of relationship. An
object might have:
Dependencies
Services that the object requires from its peers so it can perform its responsi-
bilities. The object cannot function without these services. It should not be
possible to create the object without them. For example, a graphics package
will need something like a screen or canvas to draw on—it doesn’t make
sense without one.
Notiﬁcations
Peers that need to be kept up to date with the object’s activity. The object
will notify interested peers whenever it changes state or performs a signiﬁcant
action. Notiﬁcations are “ﬁre and forget”; the object neither knows nor cares
which peers are listening. Notiﬁcations are so useful because they decouple
objects from each other. For example, in a user interface system, a button
component promises to notify any registered listeners when it’s clicked, but
does not know what those listeners will do. Similarly, the listeners expect to
be called but know nothing of the way the user interface dispatches its events.
Adjustments
Peers that adjust the object’s behavior to the wider needs of the system. This
includes policy objects that make decisions on the object’s behalf (the Strat-
egy pattern in [Gamma94]) and component parts of the object if it’s a com-
posite. For example, a Swing JTable will ask a TableCellRenderer to draw
a cell’s value, perhaps as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values for a color. If we
change the renderer, the table will change its presentation, now displaying
the HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) values.

These stereotypes are only heuristics to help us think about the design, not
hard rules, so we don’t obsess about ﬁnding just the right classiﬁcation of an
object’s peers. What matters most is the context in which the collaborating objects
are used. For example, in one application an auditing log could be a dependency,
because auditing is a legal requirement for the business and no object should be
created without an audit trail. Elsewhere, it could be a notiﬁcation, because
auditing is a user choice and objects will function perfectly well without it.
Another way to look at it is that notiﬁcations are one-way: A notiﬁcation lis-
tener may not return a value, call back the caller, or throw an exception, since
there may be other listeners further down the chain. A dependency or adjustment,
on the other hand, may do any of these, since there’s a direct relationship.
“New or new not. There is no try.”4
We try to make sure that we always create a valid object. For dependencies, this
means that we pass them in through the constructor. They’re required, so there’s
no point in creating an instance of an object until its dependencies are available,
and using the constructor enforces this constraint in the object’s deﬁnition.
Partially creating an object and then ﬁnishing it off by setting properties is brittle
because the programmer has to remember to set all the dependencies.When the
object changes to add new dependencies, the existing client code will still compile
even though it no longer constructs a valid instance. At best this will cause a
NullPointerException, at worst it will fail misleadingly.
Notiﬁcations and adjustments can be passed to the constructor as a convenience.
Alternatively, they can be initialized to safe defaults and overwritten later (note
that there is no safe default for a dependency). Adjustments can be initialized to
common values, and notiﬁcations to a null object [Woolf98] or an empty collection.
We then add methods to allow callers to change these default values, and add or
remove listeners.
Composite Simpler Than the Sum of Its Parts
All objects in a system, except for primitive types built into the language, are
composed of other objects. When composing objects into a new type, we want
the new type to exhibit simpler behavior than all of its component parts considered
together. The composite object’s API must hide the existence of its component
parts and the interactions between them, and expose a simpler abstraction to its
peers. Think of a mechanical clock: It has two or three hands for output and one
pull-out wheel for input but packages up dozens of moving parts.

In software, a user interface component for editing money values might have
two subcomponents: one for the amount and one for the currency. For the
component to be useful, its API should manage both values together, otherwise
the client code could just control it subcomponents directly.
moneyEditor.getAmountField().setText(String.valueOf(money.amount());
moneyEditor.getCurrencyField().setText(money.currencyCode());
The “Tell, Don’t Ask” convention can start to hide an object’s structure from
its clients but is not a strong enough rule by itself. For example, we could replace
the getters in the ﬁrst version with setters:
moneyEditor.setAmountField(money.amount());
moneyEditor.setCurrencyField(money.currencyCode());
This still exposes the internal structure of the component, which its client still
has to manage explicitly.
We can make the API much simpler by hiding within the component everything
about the way money values are displayed and edited, which in turn simpliﬁes
the client code:
moneyEditor.setValue(money);
This suggests a rule of thumb:
Composite Simpler Than the Sum of Its Parts
The API of a composite object should not be more complicated than that of any of
its components.
Composite objects can, of course, be used as components in larger-scale, more
sophisticated composite objects. As we grow the code, the “composite simpler
than the sum of its parts” rule contributes to raising the level of abstraction.
Context Independence
While the “composite simpler than the sum of its parts” rule helps us decide
whether an object hides enough information, the “context independence” rule
helps us decide whether an object hides too much or hides the wrong information.
A system is easier to change if its objects are context-independent; that is, if
each object has no built-in knowledge about the system in which it executes. This
allows us to take units of behavior (objects) and apply them in new situations.
To be context-independent, whatever an object needs to know about the larger
environment it’s running in must be passed in. Those relationships might be
Chapter 6

“permanent” (passed in on construction) or “transient” (passed in to the method
that needs them).
In this “paternalistic” approach, each object is told just enough to do its job
and wrapped up in an abstraction that matches its vocabulary. Eventually, the
chain of objects reaches a process boundary, which is where the system will ﬁnd
external details such as host names, ports, and user interface events.
One Domain Vocabulary
A class that uses terms from multiple domains might be violating context
independence, unless it’s part of a bridging layer.
The effect of the “context independence” rule on a system of objects is to make
their relationships explicit, deﬁned separately from the objects themselves. First,
this simpliﬁes the objects, since they don’t need to manage their own relationships.
Second, this simpliﬁes managing the relationships, since objects at the same
scale are often created and composed together in the same places, usually in
mapping-layer factory objects.
Context independence guides us towards coherent objects that can be applied
in different contexts, and towards systems that we can change by reconﬁguring
how their objects are composed.
Hiding the Right Information
Encapsulation is almost always a good thing to do, but sometimes information
can be hidden in the wrong place. This makes the code difﬁcult to understand,
to integrate, or to build behavior from by composing objects. The best defense
is to be clear about the difference between the two concepts when discussing a
design. For example, we might say:
•
“Encapsulate the data structure for the cache in the CachingAuctionLoader
class.”
•
“Encapsulate the name of the application’s log ﬁle in the PricingPolicy
class.”
These sound reasonable until we recast them in terms of information hiding:
•
“Hide the data structure used for the cache in the CachingAuctionLoader
class.”
•
“Hide the name of the application’s log ﬁle in the PricingPolicy class.”
55
Hiding the Right Information

**Page 56**

Context independence tells us that we have no business hiding details of the
log ﬁle in the PricingPolicy class—they’re concepts from different levels in
the “Russian doll” structure of nested domains. If the log ﬁle name is necessary,
it should be packaged up and passed in from a level that understands external
conﬁguration.
An Opinionated View
We’ve taken the time to describe what we think of as “good” object-oriented
design because it underlies our approach to development and we ﬁnd that it helps
us write code that we can easily grow and adapt to meet the changing needs of
its users. Now we want to show how our approach to test-driven development
supports these principles.

Achieving Object-Oriented
Design

like a rock.
—Thomas Jefferson
How Writing a Test First Helps the Design
The design principles we outlined in the previous chapter apply to ﬁnding the
right boundaries for an object so that it plays well with its neighbors—a caller
wants to know what an object does and what it depends on, but not how it
works. We also want an object to represent a coherent unit that makes sense in
its larger environment. A system built from such components will have the
ﬂexibility to reconﬁgure and adapt as requirements change.
There are three aspects of TDD that help us achieve this scoping. First, starting
with a test means that we have to describe what we want to achieve before we
consider how. This focus helps us maintain the right level of abstraction for the
target object. If the intention of the unit test is unclear then we’re probably
mixing up concepts and not ready to start coding. It also helps us with information
hiding as we have to decide what needs to be visible from outside the object.
Second, to keep unit tests understandable (and, so, maintainable), we have to
limit their scope. We’ve seen unit tests that are dozens of lines long, burying the
point of the test somewhere in its setup. Such tests tell us that the component
they’re testing is too large and needs breaking up into smaller components. The
resulting composite object should have a clearer separation of concerns as we
tease out its implicit structure, and we can write simpler tests for the extracted
objects.
Third, to construct an object for a unit test, we have to pass its dependencies
to it, which means that we have to know what they are. This encourages context
independence, since we have to be able to set up the target object’s environment
before we can unit-test it—a unit test is just another context. We’ll notice that
an object with implicit (or just too many) dependencies is painful to prepare for
testing—and make a point of cleaning it up.
In this chapter, we describe how we use an incremental, test-driven approach
to nudge our code towards the design principles we described in the previous
chapter.

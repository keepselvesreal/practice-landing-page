Line7 Added tasks for handling errors
Line8 We’re also concerned that the translator is not as clear as it could be about
Line9 what it’s doing, with its parsing and the dispatching activities mixed together.
Line10 We make a note to address this class as soon as we’ve passed the acceptance
Line11 test, which isn’t far off.
Line12 Finish the Job
Line13 Most of the work in this chapter has been trying to decide what we want to say
Line14 and how to say it: we write a high-level end-to-end test to describe what the
Line15 Sniper should implement; we write long unit test names to tell us what a class
Line16 does; we extract new classes to tease apart ﬁne-grained aspects of the functional-
Line17 ity; and we write lots of little methods to keep each layer of code at a consistent
Line18 level of abstraction. But ﬁrst, we write a rough implementation to prove that we
Line19 know how to make the code do what’s required and then we refactor—which
Line20 we’ll do in the next chapter.
Line21 We cannot emphasize strongly enough that “ﬁrst-cut” code is not ﬁnished. It’s
Line22 good enough to sort out our ideas and make sure we have everything in place,
Line23 but it’s unlikely to express its intentions cleanly. That will make it a drag on
Line24 productivity as it’s read repeatedly over the lifetime of the code. It’s like carpentry
Line25 without sanding—eventually someone ends up with a nasty splinter.

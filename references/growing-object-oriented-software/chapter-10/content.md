Chapter 10
The Walking Skeleton
In which we set up our development environment and write our ﬁrst
end-to-end test. We make some infrastructure choices that allow us to
get started, and construct a build. We’re surprised, yet again, at how
much effort this takes.
Get the Skeleton out of the Closet
So now we’ve got an idea of what to build, can we get on with it and write our
ﬁrst unit test?
Not yet.
Our ﬁrst task is to create the “walking skeleton” we described in “First, Test
a Walking Skeleton” (page 32). Again, the point of the walking skeleton is to
help us understand the requirements well enough to propose and validate a broad-
brush system structure. We can always change our minds later, when we learn
more, but it’s important to start with something that maps out the landscape of
our solution. Also, it’s very important to be able to assess the approach we’ve
chosen and to test our decisions so we can make changes with conﬁdence later.
For most projects, developing the walking skeleton takes a surprising amount
of effort. First, because deciding what to do will ﬂush out all sorts of questions
about the application and its place in the world. Second, because the automation
of building, packaging, and deploying into a production-like environment (once
we know what that means) will ﬂush out all sorts of technical and organizational
questions.
Iteration Zero
In most Agile projects, there’s a ﬁrst stage where the team is doing initial analysis,
setting up its physical and technical environments, and otherwise getting started.
The team isn’t adding much visible functionality since almost all the work is infra-
structure, so it might not make sense to count this as a conventional iteration for
scheduling purposes. A common practice is to call this step iteration zero: “iteration”
because the team still needs to time-box its activities and “zero” because it’s before
functional development starts in iteration one. One important task for iteration zero
is to use the walking skeleton to test-drive the initial architecture.
Of course, we start our walking skeleton by writing a test.

Our Very First Test
The walking skeleton must cover all the components of our Auction Sniper system:
the user interface, the sniping component, and the communication with an auction
server. The thinnest slice we can imagine testing, the ﬁrst item on our to-do list,
is that the Auction Sniper can join an auction and then wait for it to close. This
slice is so minimal that we’re not even concerned with sending a bid; we just
want to know that the two sides can communicate and that we can test the system
from outside (through the client’s GUI and by injecting events as if from the ex-
ternal auction server). Once that’s working, we have a solid base on which to
build the rest of the features that the clients want.
We like to start by writing a test as if its implementation already exists, and
then ﬁlling in whatever is needed to make it work—what Abelson and Sussman
call “programming by wishful thinking” [Abelson96]. Working backwards from
the test helps us focus on what we want the system to do, instead of getting
caught up in the complexity of how we will make it work. So, ﬁrst we code up
a test to describe our intentions as clearly as we can, given the expressive limits
of a programming language. Then we build the infrastructure to support the way
we want to test the system, instead of writing the tests to ﬁt in with an existing
infrastructure. This usually takes a large part of our initial effort because there
is so much to get ready. With this infrastructure in place, we can implement the
feature and make the test pass.
An outline of the test we want is:
1.
When an auction is selling an item,
2.
And an Auction Sniper has started to bid in that auction,
3.
Then the auction will receive a Join request from the Auction Sniper.
4.
When an auction announces that it is Closed,
5.
Then the Auction Sniper will show that it lost the auction.
This describes one transition in the state machine (see Figure 10.1).
We need to translate this into something executable. We use JUnit as our test
framework since it’s familiar and widely supported. We also need mechanisms
to control the application and the auction that the application is talking to.
Southabee’s On-Line test services are not freely available. We have to book
ahead and pay for each test session, which is not practical if we want to run tests
all the time. We’ll need a fake auction service that we can control from our
tests to behave like the real thing—or at least like we think the real thing behaves
until we get a chance to test against it for real. This fake auction, or stub, will
be as simple as we can make it. It will connect to an XMPP message broker,
receive commands from the Sniper to be checked by the test, and allow the test
to send back events. We’re not trying to reimplement all of Southabee’s On-Line,
just enough of it to support test scenarios.

Figure 10.1
A Sniper joins, then loses
Controlling the Sniper application is more complicated. We want our skeleton
test to exercise our application as close to end-to-end as possible, to show that
the main() method initializes the application correctly and that the components
really work together. This means that we should start by working through the
publicly visible features of the application (in this case, its user interface) instead
of directly invoking its domain objects. We also want our test to be clear about
what is being checked, written in terms of the relationship between a Sniper and
its auction, so we’ll hide all the messy code for manipulating Swing in an
ApplicationRunner class. We’ll start by writing the test as if all the code it needs
exists and will ﬁll in the implementations afterwards.
public class AuctionSniperEndToEndTest {
  private final FakeAuctionServer auction = new FakeAuctionServer("item-54321");
  private final ApplicationRunner application = new ApplicationRunner();
  @Test public void sniperJoinsAuctionUntilAuctionCloses() throws Exception {
    auction.startSellingItem();                 // Step 1
    application.startBiddingIn(auction);        // Step 2
    auction.hasReceivedJoinRequestFromSniper(); // Step 3
    auction.announceClosed();                   // Step 4
    application.showsSniperHasLostAuction();    // Step 5
  }
// Additional cleanup
  @After public void stopAuction() {
    auction.stop();
  }
  @After public void stopApplication() {
    application.stop();
  }
}

We’ve adopted certain naming conventions for the methods of the helper ob-
jects. If a method triggers an event to drive the test, its name will be a command,
such as startBiddingIn(). If a method asserts that something should have hap-
pened, its name will be descriptive;1 for example, showsSniperHasLostAuction()
will throw an exception if the application is not showing the auction status as
lost. JUnit will call the two stop() methods after the test has run, to clean up
the runtime environment.
In writing the test, one of the assumptions we’ve made is that a
FakeAuctionServer is tied to a given item. This matches the structure of our
intended architecture, where Southabee’s On-Line hosts multiple auctions, each
selling a single item.
One Domain at a Time
The language of this test is concerned with auctions and Snipers; there’s nothing
about messaging layers or components in the user interface—that’s all incidental
detail here. Keeping the language consistent helps us understand what’s signiﬁcant
in this test, with a nice side effect of protecting us when the implementation inevitably
changes.
Some Initial Choices
Now we have to make the test pass, which will require a lot of preparation. We
need to ﬁnd or write four components: an XMPP message broker, a stub auction
that can communicate over XMPP, a GUI testing framework, and a test har-
ness that can cope with our multithreaded, asynchronous architecture. We also
have to get the project under version control with an automated build/deploy/test
process. Compared to unit-testing a single class, there is a lot to do—but it’s es-
sential. Even at this high level, the exercise of writing tests drives the development
of the system. Working through our ﬁrst end-to-end test will force some of the
structural decisions we need to make, such as packaging and deployment.
First the package selection, we will need an XMPP message broker to let the
application talk to our stub auction house. After some investigation, we decide
on an open source implementation called Openﬁre and its associated client library
Smack. We also need a high-level test framework that can work with Swing
and Smack, both of which are multithreaded and event-driven. Luckily for us,
there are several frameworks for testing Swing applications and the way that
they deal with Swing’s multithreaded, event-driven architecture also works well
with XMPP messaging. We pick WindowLicker which is open source and supports
1. For the grammatically pedantic, the names of methods that trigger events are in the
imperative mood whereas the names of assertions are in the indicative mood.

the asynchronous approach that we need in our tests. When assembled, the
infrastructure will look like Figure 10.2:

The end-to-end test rig
End-to-End Testing
End-to-end testing for event-based systems, such as our Sniper, has to cope with
asynchrony. The tests run in parallel with the application and do not know pre-
cisely when the application is or isn’t ready. This is unlike unit testing, where a
test drives an object directly in the same thread and so can make direct assertions
about its state and behavior.
An end-to-end test can’t peek inside the target application, so it must wait to
detect some visible effect, such as a user interface change or an entry in a log.
The usual technique is to poll for the effect and fail if it doesn’t happen within
a given time limit. There’s a further complexity in that the target application has
to stabilize after the triggering event long enough for the test to catch the result.
An asynchronous test waiting for a value that just ﬂashes on the screen will be
too unreliable for an automated build, so a common technique is to control the
application and step through the scenario. At each stage, the test waits for an
assertion to pass, then sends an event to wake the application for the next step.
See Chapter 14 for a full discussion of testing asynchronous behavior.
All this makes end-to-end testing slower and more brittle (perhaps the test
network is just busy today), so failures might need interpretation. We’ve heard
of teams where timing-related tests have to fail several times in a row before
they’re reported. This is unlike unit tests which must all pass every time.
In our case, both Swing and the messaging infrastructure are asynchronous,
so using WindowLicker (which polls for values) to drive the Sniper covers the
natural asynchrony of our end-to-end testing.

Ready to Start
You might have noticed that we skipped over one point: this ﬁrst test is not really
end-to-end. It doesn’t include the real auction service because that is not easily
available. An important part of the test-driven development skills is judging where
to set the boundaries of what to test and how to eventually cover everything. In
this case, we have to start with a fake auction service based on the documentation
from Southabee’s On-Line. The documentation might or might not be correct,
so we will record that as a known risk in the project plan and schedule time to
test against the real server as soon as we have enough functionality to complete
a meaningful transaction—even if we end up buying a hideous (but cheap) pair
of candlesticks in a real auction. The sooner we ﬁnd a discrepancy, the less code
we will have based on that misunderstanding and the more time to ﬁx it.
We’d better get on with it.

Chapter 11
Passing the First Test
In which we write test infrastructure to drive our non-existent applica-
tion, so that we can make the ﬁrst test fail. We repeatedly fail the test
and ﬁx symptoms, until we have a minimal working application that
passes the ﬁrst test. We step through this very slowly to show how the
process works.
Building the Test Rig
At the start of every test run, our test script starts up the Openﬁre server, creates
accounts for the Sniper and the auction, and then runs the tests. Each test will
start instances of the application and the fake auction, and then test their com-
munication through the server. At ﬁrst, we’ll run everything on the same host.
Later, as the infrastructure stabilizes, we can consider running different compo-
nents on different machines, which will be a better match to the real deployment.
This leaves us with two components to write for the test infrastructure:
ApplicationRunner and FakeAuctionServer.
Setting Up the Openﬁre Server
At the time of writing, we were using version 3.6 of Openﬁre. For these end-to-
end tests, we set up our local server with three user accounts and passwords:
sniper
sniper
auction-item-54321
auction
auction-item-65432
auction
For desktop development, we usually started the server by hand and left it running.
We set it up to not store ofﬂine messages, which meant there was no persistent
state. In the System Manager, we edited the “System Name” property to be
localhost, so the tests would run consistently. Finally, we set the resource policy
to “Never kick,” which will not allow a new resource to log in if there’s a conﬂict.

The basics of unit testing
Manual tests suck. You write your code, you run it in the debugger, you hit all the
right keys in your app to get things just right, and then you repeat all this the next
time you write new code. And you have to remember to check all the other code
that might have been affected by the new code. More manual work. Great.
 Doing tests and regression testing completely manually, repeating the same
actions again and again like a monkey, is error prone and time consuming, and
people seem to hate doing that as much as anything can be hated in software devel-
opment. These problems are alleviated by tooling and our decision to use it for
good, by writing automated tests that save us precious time and debugging pain.
Integration and unit testing frameworks help developers write tests more quickly
with a set of known APIs, execute those tests automatically, and review the results of

those tests easily. And they never forget! I’m assuming you’re reading this book
because either you feel the same way, or because someone forced you to read it, and
that someone feels the same way. Or maybe that someone was forced to force you into
reading this book. Doesn’t matter. If you believe repetitive manual testing is awesome,
this book will be very difficult to read. The assumption is that you want to learn how to
write good unit tests. 
 This book also assumes that you know how to write code using JavaScript or Type-
Script, using at least ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features, and that you are comfortable with
node package manager (npm). Another assumption is that you are familiar with Git
source control. If you’ve seen github.com before and you know how to clone a reposi-
tory from there, you are good to go.
 Although all the book’s code listings are in JavaScript and TypeScript, you don’t
have to be a JavaScript programmer to read this book. The previous editions of this
book were in C#, and I’ve found that about 80% of the patterns there have transferred
over quite easily. You should be able to read this book even if you come from Java,
.NET, Python, Ruby, or other languages. The patterns are just patterns. The language
is used to demonstrate those patterns, but they are not language-specific.
JavaScript vs. TypeScript in this book
This book contains both vanilla JavaScript and TypeScript examples throughout. I
take full responsibility for creating such a Tower of Babel (no pun intended), but I prom-
ise, there’s a good reason: this book is dealing with three programming paradigms in
JavaScript: procedural, functional, and object-oriented design. 
I use regular JavaScript for the samples dealing with procedural and functional
designs. I use TypeScript for the object-oriented examples, because it provides the
structure needed to express these ideas. 
In previous editions of this book, when I was working in C#, this wasn’t an issue.
When moving to JavaScript, which supports these multiple paradigms, using Type-
Script makes sense.
Why not just use TypeScript for all the paradigms, you ask? Both to show that Type-
Script is not needed to write unit tests and that the concepts of unit testing do not
depend on one language or another, or on any type of compiler or linter, to work.
This means that if you’re into functional programming, some of the examples in this
book will make sense, and others will seem like they are overcomplicated or need-
lessly verbose. Feel free to focus only on the functional examples.
If you’re into object-oriented programming or are coming from a C#/Java background,
you’ll find that some of the non-object-oriented examples are simplistic and don’t rep-
resent your day-to-day work in your own projects. Fear not, there will be plenty of sec-
tions relating to the object-oriented style.

1.2
Defining unit testing, step by step
1.1
The first step
There’s always a first step: the first time you wrote a program, the first time you failed
a project, and the first time you succeeded in what you were trying to accomplish. You
never forget your first time, and I hope you won’t forget your first tests. 
 You may have come across tests in some form. Some of your favorite open source
projects come with bundled “test” folders—you have them in your own projects at
work. You might have already written a few tests yourself, and you may even remember
them as being bad, awkward, slow, or unmaintainable. Even worse, you might have felt
they were useless and a waste of time. (Many people sadly do.) Or you may have had a
great first experience with unit tests, and you’re reading this book to see what more
you might be missing. 
 This chapter will analyze the “classic” definition of a unit test and compare it to the
concept of integration testing. This distinction is confusing to many, but it’s very
important to learn, because, as you’ll learn later in the book, separating unit tests
from other types of tests can be crucial to having high confidence in your tests when
they fail or pass.
 We’ll also discuss the pros and cons of unit testing versus integration testing, and
we’ll develop a better definition of what might be a “good” unit test. We’ll finish with a
look at test-driven development (TDD), because it’s often associated with unit testing
but is a separate skill that I highly recommend giving a chance (it’s not the main topic
of this book, though). Throughout this chapter, I’ll also touch on concepts that are
explained more thoroughly elsewhere in the book.
 First, let’s define what a unit test should be.
1.2
Defining unit testing, step by step
Unit testing isn’t a new concept in software development. It’s been floating around
since the early days of the Smalltalk programming language in the 1970s, and it
proves itself time and time again as one of the best ways a developer can improve code
quality while gaining a deeper understanding of the functional requirements of a
module, class, or function. Kent Beck introduced the concept of unit testing in Small-
talk, and it has carried on into many other programming languages, making unit test-
ing an extremely useful practice. 
 To see what we don’t want to use as our definition of unit testing, let’s look to Wiki-
pedia as a starting point. I’ll use its definition with reservations, because, in my opin-
ion, there are many important parts missing, but it is largely accepted by many for lack
of other good definitions. Our definition will slowly evolve throughout this chapter,
with the final definition appearing in section 1.9. 
Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure
that a section of an application (known as the “unit”) meets its design and behaves as
intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more
commonly an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented programming, a unit

CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
is often an entire interface, such as a class, or an individual method (https://en
.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing).
The thing you’ll write tests for is the subject, system, or suite under test (SUT).
DEFINITION
SUT stands for subject, system, or suite under test, and some people
like to use CUT (component, class, or code under test). When you test something,
you refer to the thing you’re testing as the SUT.
Let’s talk about the word “unit” in unit testing. To me, unit stands for a “unit of work”
or a “use case” inside the system. A unit of work has a beginning and an end, which I
call an entry point and an exit point. A simple example of a unit of work is a function
that calculates something and returns a value. However, a function could also use
other functions, other modules, and other components in the calculation process,
which means the unit of work (from entry point to exit point), could span more than
just a function.
1.3
Entry points and exit points
A unit of work always has an entry point and one or
more exit points. Figure 1.1 shows a simple diagram
of a unit of work.
 A unit of work can be a single function, multiple
functions, or even multiple modules or components.
But it always has an entry point that we can trigger
from the outside (via tests or other production code),
and it always ends up doing something useful. If it
doesn’t do anything useful, we might as well remove it
from our codebase. 
 What’s useful? Something publicly noticeable that
happens in the code: a return value, a state change,
or calling an external party, as shown in figure 1.2.
Those noticeable behaviors are what I call exit points. 
Unit of work
A unit of work is all the actions that take place between the invocation of an entry
point up until a noticeable end result through one or more exit points. The entry point
is the thing we trigger. Given a publicly visible function, for example
The function’s body is all or part of the unit of work. 
The function’s declaration and signature are the entry point into the body. 
The resulting outputs or behaviors of the function are its exit points.

1.3
Entry points and exit points
The following listing shows a quick code example of a simple unit of work. 
const sum = (numbers) => {
  const [a, b] = numbers.split(',');
  const result = parseInt(a) + parseInt(b);
  return result;
};
Why “exit point”?
Why use the term “exit point” and not something like “behavior”? My thinking is that
behaviors can be purely internal, whereas we’re looking for externally visible behav-
iors from the caller. That difference might be difficult to distinguish at a glance. Also,
“exit point” nicely suggests we are leaving the context of a unit of work and going
back to the test context, though behaviors might be a bit more fluid than that. There’s
an extensive discussion about types of behavior, including observable behavior, in
Unit Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns by Vladimir Khorikov (Manning, 2020).
Refer to that book to learn more about this topic.

About the JavaScript version used in this book
I’ve chosen to use Node.js 12.8 with plain ES6 JavaScript along with JSDoc-style com-
ments. The module system I’ll use is CommonJS, to keep things simple. Perhaps in a
future edition I’ll start using ES modules (.mjs files), but for now, and for the rest of this
book, CommonJS will do. It doesn’t really matter for the patterns in this book anyway. 
You should be able to easily extrapolate the techniques used here for whatever
JavaScript stack you’re currently working with, whether you’re using TypeScript, Plain
JS, ES modules, backend or frontend, Angular, or React. It shouldn’t matter.

CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
This unit of work is completely encompassed in a
single function. The function is the entry point,
and because its end result returns a value, it also
acts as the exit point. We get the end result in the
same place we trigger the unit of work, so the entry
point is also the exit point.
 If we drew this function as a unit of work, it
would look something like figure 1.3. I used
sum(numbers) as the entry point, not numbers,
because the entry point is the function signature.
The parameters are the context or input given
through the entry point.
 The following listing shows a variation on this
idea. 
let total = 0;
const totalSoFar = () => {
  return total;
};
const sum = (numbers) => {
  const [a, b] = numbers.split(',');
  const result = parseInt(a) + parseInt(b);
  total += result;    
  return result;
};
This new version of sum has two exit points. It does two things: 
It returns a value.
It introduces new functionality: a running total of all the sums. It sets the state
of the module in a way that is noticeable (via totalSoFar) from the caller of the
entry point.
Getting the code for this chapter
You can download all the code samples shown in this book from GitHub. You can find
the repository at https://github.com/royosherove/aout3-samples. Make sure you
have Node 12.8 or higher installed, and run npm install followed by npm run
ch[chapter number]. For this chapter, you would run npm run ch1. This will run all
the tests for this chapter so you can see their outputs.

1.3
Entry points and exit points
Figure 1.4 shows how I would draw this unit of
work. You can think of these two exit points as
two different paths, or requirements, from the
same unit of work, because they indeed are two
different useful things the code is expected to
do. This also means I’d be very likely to write
two different unit tests here: one for each exit
point. Very soon we’ll do exactly that.
 What about totalSoFar? Is this also an
entry point? Yes, it could be, in a separate test. I
could write a test that proves that calling
totalSoFar without triggering prior to that
call returns 0. That would make it its own little
unit of work, which would be perfectly fine.
Often one unit of work (such as sum) can be
composed of smaller units. 
 As you can see, the scope of our tests can change and mutate, but we can still
define them with entry points and exit points. Entry points are always where the test
triggers the unit of work. You can have multiple entry points into a unit of work, each
used by a different set of tests. 
A note on design
There are two main types of actions: “query” actions and “command” actions. Query
actions don’t change stuff; they just return values. Command actions change stuff
but don’t return values. 
We often combine the two, but there are many cases where separating them might
be a better design choice. This book isn’t primarily about design, but I urge you to
read more about the concept of command query separation over on Martin Fowler’s
website: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html.
Exit points signifying requirements and new tests, and vice versa
Exit points are end results of a unit of work. For unit tests, I usually write at least one
test, with its own readable name, for each exit point. I may then add more tests with
variations on the inputs, all using the same entry point, to gain more confidence. 
Integration tests, which we’ll discuss later in this chapter and in the book, usually
include multiple end results, since it can be impossible to separate code paths at
those levels. That’s also one of the reasons integration tests are harder to debug,
get up and running, and maintain: they do much more than unit tests, as you’ll
soon see.

CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
A third version of our example function is shown in the following listing.
let total = 0;
const totalSoFar = () => {
  return total;
};
const logger = makeLogger();
const sum = (numbers) => {
  const [a, b] = numbers.split(',');
  logger.info(                               
    'this is a very important log output',   
    { firstNumWas: a, secondNumWas: b });    
  const result = parseInt(a) + parseInt(b);
  total += result;
  return result;
};
You can see that there’s a new exit point (or requirement, or end result) in the func-
tion. It logs something to an external entity—perhaps to a file, or the console, or a
database. We don’t know, and we don’t care. This is the third type of exit point: calling
a third party. I also like to refer to it as “calling a dependency.” 
DEFINITION
A dependency is something we don’t have full control over during
a unit test. Or it can be something that trying to control in a test would
make our lives miserable. Some examples would include loggers that write
to files, things that talk to the network, code that’s controlled by other teams,
components that take a long time (calculations, threads, database access),
and more. The rule of thumb is that if we can fully and easily control what
it’s doing, and it runs in memory, and it’s fast, then it’s not a dependency.
There are always exceptions to the rule, but this should get you through
80% of the cases, at least.
Figure 1.5 shows how I’d draw this unit of work with all three exit points. At this point
we’re still discussing a function-sized unit of work. The entry point is the function call,
but now we have three possible paths, or exit points, that do something useful and
that the caller can verify publicly.
 Here’s where it gets interesting: it’s a good idea to have a separate test for each exit
point. This will make the tests more readable and simpler to debug or change without
affecting other outcomes.

Exit point types
1.4
Exit point types
We’ve seen that we have three different types of end results:
The invoked function returns a useful value (not undefined). If this was in a stati-
cally typed language such as Java or C#, we’d say it is a public, non-void function.
There’s a noticeable change to the state or behavior of the system before and
after invocation that can be determined without interrogating private state.
There’s a callout to a third-party system over which the test has no control. That
third-party system doesn’t return any value, or that value is ignored. (Example:
the code calls a third-party logging system that was not written by you, and you
don’t control its source code.)
Let’s see how the idea of entry and exit points affects the definition of a unit test: A
unit test is a piece of code that invokes a unit of work and checks one specific exit point
as an end result of that unit of work. If the assumptions about the end result turn out
to be wrong, the unit test has failed. A unit test’s scope can span as little as a function
or as much as multiple modules or components, depending on how many functions
and modules are used between the entry point and the exit point. 
XUnit Test Patterns’ definition of entry and exit points
Gerard Meszaros’ book XUnit Test Patterns (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2007) dis-
cusses the notion of direct inputs and outputs, and indirect inputs and outputs. Direct
inputs are what I like to call entry points. Meszaros refers to it as “using the front
door” of a component. Indirect outputs in that book are the other two types of exit
points I mentioned (state change and calling a third party). 
Both versions of these ideas have evolved in parallel, but the idea of a “unit of work”
only appears in this book. A unit of work, coupled with entry and exit points, makes
much more sense to me than direct and indirect inputs and outputs, but you can con-
sider this a stylistic choice about how to teach the concept of test scopes. You can
find more about XUnit Test Patterns at xunitpatterns.com.

CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
1.5
Different exit points, different techniques
Why am I spending so much time talking about types of exit points? Because not only
is it a great idea to separate the tests for each exit point, but different types of exit
points might require different techniques to test successfully:
Return-value-based exit points (direct outputs in Meszaros’ XUnit Test Patterns)
should be the easiest exit points to test. You trigger an entry point, you get
something back, and you check the value you got back.
State-based tests (indirect outputs) usually require a little more gymnastics. You
call something, and then you do another call to check something else (or you
call the previous thing again) to see if everything went according to plan. 
In a third-party situation (indirect outputs), we have the most hoops to jump through.
We haven’t discussed this yet, but that’s where we’re forced to use things like mock
objects to replace the external system with something we can control and interrogate in
our tests. I’ll cover this idea deeply later in the book. 
1.6
A test from scratch
Let’s go back to the first, simplest version of the
code (listing 1.1) and try to test it, shall we? If we
were to try to write a test for this, what would it
look like? 
 Let’s take the visual approach first with figure 1.6.
Our entry point is sum with an input of a string called
numbers. sum is also our exit point, since we will get a
return value back from it and check its value.
 It’s possible to write an automated unit test
without using a test framework. In fact, because
developers have gotten more into the habit of
automating their testing, I’ve seen plenty of them
doing this before discovering test frameworks. In
this section, we’ll write such a test without a frame-
work, so that you can contrast this approach with
using a framework in chapter 2.
Which exit points make the most problems?
As a rule of thumb, I try to mostly use either return-value-based or state-based tests. I
try to avoid mock-object-based tests if I can, and usually I can. As a result, I usually
have no more than 5% of my tests using mock objects for verification. Those types of
tests complicate things and make maintainability more difficult. Sometimes there’s no
escape, though, and we’ll discuss them as we proceed in the next chapters.

1.6
A test from scratch
 So, let’s assume test frameworks don’t exist (or that we don’t know they do). We
have decided to write our own little automated test from scratch. The following listing
shows a very naive example of testing our own code with plain JavaScript.
const parserTest = () => {
  try {
    const result = sum('1,2');
    if (result === 3) {
      console.log('parserTest example 1 PASSED');
    } else {
      throw new Error(`parserTest: expected 3 but was ${result}`);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e.stack);
  }
};
No, this code is not lovely. But it’s good enough to explain how tests work. To run this
code, we can do the following:
1
Open the command line and type an empty string.
2
Add an entry under package.json’s "scripts" entry under "test" to execute
"node mytest.js" and then execute npm test on the command line. 
The following listing shows this.
{
  "name": "aout3-samples",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Code Samples for Art of Unit Testing 3rd Edition",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node ./ch1-basics/custom-test-phase1.js",
  }
}
The test method invokes the production module (the SUT) and then checks the returned
value. If it’s not what’s expected, the test method writes to the console an error and a
stack trace. The test method also catches any exceptions that occur and writes them to
the console, so that they don’t interfere with the running of subsequent methods. When
we use a test framework, that’s usually handled for us automatically.
 Obviously, this is an ad hoc way of writing such a test. If you were to write multiple
tests like this, you might want to have a generic test or check method that all tests
could use, and which would format the errors consistently. You could also add special
helper methods that would check on things like null objects, empty strings, and so on,
so that you don’t need to write the same long lines of code in many tests.

CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
 The following listing shows what this test would look like with a slightly more
generic check and assertEquals functions.
const assertEquals = (expected, actual) => {
  if (actual !== expected) {
    throw new Error(`Expected ${expected} but was ${actual}`);
  }
};
const check = (name, implementation) => {
  try {
    implementation();
    console.log(`${name} passed`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(`${name} FAILED`, e.stack);
  }
};
check('sum with 2 numbers should sum them up', () => {
  const result = sum('1,2');
  assertEquals(3, result);
});
check('sum with multiple digit numbers should sum them up', () => {
  const result = sum('10,20');
  assertEquals(30, result);
});
We’ve now created two helper methods: assertEquals, which removes boilerplate
code for writing to the console or throwing errors, and check, which takes a string for
the name of the test and a callback to the implementation. It then takes care of catch-
ing any test errors, writing them to the console, and reporting on the status of the test.
Notice how the tests are easier to read and faster to write with just a couple of helper
methods. Unit testing frameworks such as Jest can provide even more generic helper
Listing 1.6
Using a more generic implementation of the Check method
Built-in asserts
It’s important to note that we don’t need to write our own asserts. We could have
easily used Node.js’s built-in assert functions, which were originally built for internal
use in testing Node.js itself. We could do so by importing the functions with 
const assert = require('assert'); 
However, I’m trying to demonstrate the underlying simplicity of the concept, so we’ll
avoid that. You can find more info about Node.js’s assert module at https://nodejs
.org/api/assert.html.

1.7
Characteristics of a good unit test
methods like this, so tests are even easier to write. I’ll talk about that in chapter 2.
First, let’s talk a bit about the main subject of this book: good unit tests. 
1.7
Characteristics of a good unit test
No matter what programming language you’re using, one of the most difficult aspects
of defining a unit test is defining what’s meant by a good one. Of course, good is rela-
tive, and it can change whenever we learn something new about coding. That may
seem obvious, but it really isn’t. I need to explain why we need to write better tests—
understanding what a unit of work is isn’t enough.
 Based on my own experience, involving many companies and teams over the years,
most people who try to unit test their code either give up at some point or don’t actu-
ally perform unit tests. They waste a lot of time writing problematic tests, and they give
up when they have to spend a lot of time maintaining them, or worse, they don’t trust
their results. 
 There’s no point in writing a bad unit test, unless you’re in the process of learning
how to write a good one. There are more downsides than upsides to writing bad tests,
such as wasting time debugging buggy tests, wasting time writing tests that bring no
benefit, wasting time trying to understand unreadable tests, and wasting time writing
tests only to delete them a few months later. There’s also a huge issue with maintain-
ing bad tests, and with how they affect the maintainability of production code. Bad
tests can actually slow down your development speed, not only when writing test code,
but also when writing production code. I’ll touch on all these things later in the book.
 By learning what a good unit test is, you can be sure you aren’t starting off on a
path that will be hard to fix later on, when the code becomes a nightmare. We’ll also
define other forms of tests (component, end to end, and more) later in the book.
1.7.1
What is a good unit test? 
Every good automated test (not just unit tests) should have the following properties:
It should be easy to understand the intent of the test author.
It should be easy to read and write.
It should be automated.
It should be consistent in its results (it should always return the same result if
you don’t change anything between runs).
It should be useful and provide actionable results.
Anyone should be able to run it with the push of a button.
When it fails, it should be easy to detect what was expected and determine how
to pinpoint the problem.
A good unit test should also exhibit the following properties: 
It should run quickly.
It should have full control of the code under test (more on that in chapter 3).
It should be fully isolated (run independently of other tests).


---
**Page 16**

16
CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
It should run in memory without requiring system files, networks, or databases.
It should be as synchronous and linear as possible when that makes sense (no
parallel threads if we can help it).
It’s impossible for all tests to follow the properties of a good unit test, and that’s
fine. Such tests will simply transition to the realm of integration testing (the topic of
section 1.8). Still, there are ways to refactor some of your tests to conform to these
properties.
REPLACING THE DATABASE (OR ANOTHER DEPENDENCY) WITH A STUB
We’ll discuss stubs in later chapters, but, in short, they are fake dependencies that
emulate the real ones. Their purpose is to simplify the process of testing because they
are easier to set up and maintain.
 Beware of in-memory databases, though. They can help you isolate tests from
each other (as long as you don’t share database instances between tests) and thus
adhere to the properties of good unit tests, but such databases lead to an awkward,
in-between spot. In-memory databases aren’t as easy to set up as stubs. At the same
time, they don’t provide as strong guarantees as real databases. Functionality-wise, an
in-memory database may differ drastically from the production one, so tests that pass
an in-memory database may fail the real one, and vice versa. You’ll often have to rerun
the same tests manually against the production database to gain additional confi-
dence that your code works. Unless you use a small and standardized set of SQL fea-
tures, I recommend sticking to either stubs (for unit tests) or real databases (for
integration testing).
 The same is true for solutions like jsdom. You can use it to replace the real DOM,
but make sure it supports your particular use cases. Don’t write tests that require you
to manually recheck them.
EMULATING ASYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING WITH LINEAR, SYNCHRONOUS TESTS
With the advent of promises and async/await, asynchronous coding has become stan-
dard in JavaScript. Our tests can still verify asynchronous code synchronously, though.
Usually that means triggering callbacks directly from the test or explicitly waiting for
an asynchronous operation to finish executing.
1.7.2
A unit test checklist
Many people confuse the act of testing their software with the concept of a unit test.
To start off, ask yourself the following questions about the tests you’ve written and exe-
cuted up to now:
Can I run and get results from a test I wrote two weeks or months or years ago?
Can any member of my team run and get results from tests I wrote two
months ago?
Can I run all the tests I’ve written in no more than a few minutes?
Can I run all the tests I’ve written at the push of a button?

Integration tests
Can I write a basic test in no more than a few minutes?
Do my tests pass when there are bugs in another team’s code?
Do my tests show the same results when run on different machines or environ-
ments?
Do my tests stop working if there’s no database, network, or deployment?
If I delete, move, or change one test, do other tests remain unaffected?
If you answered “no” to any of these questions, there’s a high probability that what
you’re implementing either isn’t fully automated or it isn’t a unit test. It’s definitely
some kind of test, and it might be as important as a unit test, but it has drawbacks com-
pared to tests that would let you answer yes to all of those questions.
 “What was I doing until now?” you might ask. You’ve been doing integration testing. 
1.8
Integration tests
I consider integration tests to be any tests that don’t live up to one or more of the condi-
tions outlined previously for good unit tests. For example, if the test uses the real net-
work, the real rest APIs, the real system time, the real filesystem, or a real database, it
has stepped into the realm of integration testing.
 If a test doesn’t have control of the system time, for example, and it uses the cur-
rent new Date() in the test code, then every time the test executes, it’s essentially a dif-
ferent test because it uses a different time. It’s no longer consistent. That’s not a bad
thing per se. I think integration tests are important counterparts to unit tests, but they
should be separated from them to achieve a feeling of “safe green zone,” which is dis-
cussed later in this book.
 If a test uses the real database, it’s no longer only running in memory—its actions
are harder to erase than when using only in-memory fake data. The test will also run
longer, and we won’t easily be able to control how long data access takes. Unit tests
should be fast. Integration tests are usually much slower. When you start having hun-
dreds of tests, every half-second counts.
 Integration tests increase the risk of another problem: testing too many things at
once. For example, suppose your car breaks down. How do you learn what the prob-
lem is, let alone fix it? An engine consists of many subsystems working together,
each relying on the others to help produce the final result: a moving car. If the car
stops moving, the fault could be with any of the subsystems—or with more than one.
It’s the integration of those subsystems (or layers) that makes the car move. You
could think of the car’s movement as the ultimate integration test of these parts as
the car goes down the road. If the test fails, all the parts fail together; if it succeeds,
all the parts succeed. 
 The same thing happens in software. The way most developers test their function-
ality is through the final functionality of the app or REST API or UI. Clicking some
button triggers a series of events—functions, modules, and components working
together to produce the final result. If the test fails, all of these software components

CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
fail as a team, and it can be difficult to figure out what caused the failure of the overall
operation (see figure 1.7).
As defined in The Complete Guide to Software Testing by Bill Hetzel (Wiley, 1988), integra-
tion testing is “an orderly progression of testing in which software and/or hardware
elements are combined and tested until the entire system has been integrated.”
Here’s my own variation on defining integration testing:
Integration testing is testing a unit of work without having full control over all of its real
dependencies, such as other components by other teams, other services, the time, the
network, databases, threads, random number generators, and more.
To summarize, an integration test uses real dependencies; unit tests isolate the unit of
work from its dependencies so that they’re easily consistent in their results and can
easily control and simulate any aspect of the unit’s behavior.
 Let’s apply the questions from section 1.7.2 to integration tests and consider what
you want to achieve with real-world unit tests: 
Can I run and get results from a test I wrote two weeks or months or years ago? 
If you can’t, how would you know whether you broke a feature that you created
earlier? Shared data and code changes regularly during the life of an application,

You can have many failure points in an integration test. All the units have to work together, and each 
could malfunction, making it harder to find the source of a bug.

1.8
Integration tests
and if you can’t (or won’t) run tests for all the previously working features after
changing your code, you just might break it without knowing—this is known as
a regression. Regressions seem to occur a lot near the end of a sprint or release,
when developers are under pressure to fix existing bugs. Sometimes they intro-
duce new bugs inadvertently as they resolve old ones. Wouldn’t it be great to
know that you broke something within 60 seconds of breaking it? You’ll see how
that can be done later in this book.
DEFINITION
A regression is broken functionality—code that used to work. You
can also think of it as one or more units of work that once worked and now
don’t. 
Can any member of my team run and get results from tests I wrote two months ago?
This goes with the previous point but takes it up a notch. You want to make sure
that you don’t break someone else’s code when you change something. Many
developers fear changing legacy code in older systems for fear of not knowing
what other code depends on what they’re changing. In essence, they risk chang-
ing the system into an unknown state of stability.
Few things are scarier than not knowing whether the application still works,
especially when you didn’t write that code. If you have that safety net of unit
tests and know you aren’t breaking anything, you’ll be much less afraid of tak-
ing on code you’re less familiar with. 
Good tests can be accessed and run by anyone.
DEFINITION
Legacy code is defined by Wikipedia as “old computer source code
that is no longer supported on the standard hardware and environments”
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system), but many shops refer to any
older version of the application currently under maintenance as legacy code.
It often refers to code that’s hard to work with, hard to test, and usually even
hard to read. A client once defined legacy code in a down-to-earth way: “code
that works.” Many people like to define legacy code as “code that has no
tests.” Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers (Pearson, 2004)
uses “code that has no tests” as an official definition of legacy code, and it’s a
definition to be considered while reading this book.
Can I run all the tests I’ve written in no more than a few minutes?
If you can’t run your tests quickly (seconds are better than minutes), you’ll run
them less often (daily, or even weekly or monthly in some places). The problem
is that when you change code, you want to get feedback as early as possible to
see if you broke something. The more time required between running the tests,
the more changes you make to the system, and the (many) more places you’ll
have to search for bugs when you find that you broke something. 
Good tests should run quickly.

CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
Can I run all the tests I’ve written at the push of a button?
If you can’t, it probably means that you have to configure the machine on
which the tests will run so that they run correctly (setting up a Docker envi-
ronment, or setting connection strings to the database, for example), or it
may mean that your unit tests aren’t fully automated. If you can’t fully auto-
mate your unit tests, you’ll probably avoid running them repeatedly, as will
everyone else on your team.
No one likes to get bogged down with configuring details to run tests, just to
make sure that the system still works. Developers have more important things to
do, like writing more features into the system. But they can’t do that if they
don’t know the state of the system.
Good tests should be easily executed in their original form, not manually.
Can I write a basic test in no more than a few minutes?
One of the easiest ways to spot an integration test is that it takes time to prepare
correctly and to implement, not just to execute. It takes time to figure out how to
write it because of all the internal, and sometimes external, dependencies. (A
database may be considered an external dependency.) If you’re not automating
the test, dependencies are less of a problem, but you’re losing all the benefits of
an automated test. The harder it is to write a test, the less likely you are to write
more tests or to focus on anything other than the “big stuff” that you’re worried
about. One of the strengths of unit tests is that they tend to test every little thing
that might break, not only the big stuff. People are often surprised at how many
bugs they can find in code they thought was simple and bug free. 
When you concentrate only on the big tests, the overall confidence in your
code is still very much lacking. Many parts of the code’s core logic aren’t tested
(even though you may be covering more components), and there may be many
bugs that you haven’t considered and might be “unofficially” worried about.
Good tests against the system should be easy and quick to write, once you’ve
figured out the patterns you want to use to test your specific set of objects, func-
tions, and dependencies (the domain model). 
Do my tests pass when there are bugs in another team’s code? Do my tests show the same
results when run on different machines or environments? Do my tests stop working if
there’s no database, network, or deployment?
These three points refer to the idea that our test code is isolated from various
dependencies. The test results are consistent because we have control over what
those indirect inputs into our system provide. We can have fake databases, fake
networks, fake time, and fake machine culture. In later chapters, I’ll refer to
those points as stubs and seams in which we can inject those stubs.
If I delete, move, or change one test, do other tests remain unaffected?
Unit tests usually don’t need to have any shared state, but integration tests often
do, such as an external database or service. Shared state can create a dependency

Finalizing our definition
between tests. For example, running tests in the wrong order can corrupt the
state for future tests.
WARNING
Even experienced unit testers can find that it may take 30 minutes
or more to figure out how to write the very first unit test against a domain
model they’ve never unit tested before. This is part of the work and is to be
expected. The second and subsequent tests on that domain model should be
very easy to accomplish once you’ve figured out the entry and exit points of
the unit of work. 
We can recognize three main criteria in the previous questions and answers:
Readability—If we can’t read it, then it’s hard to maintain, hard to debug, and
hard to know what’s wrong.
Maintainability—If maintaining the test or production code is painful because
of the tests, our lives will become a living nightmare. 
Trust—If we don’t trust the results of our tests when they fail, we’ll start manu-
ally testing again, losing all the time benefit the tests are supposed to provide. If
we don’t trust the tests when they pass, we’ll start debugging more, again losing
any time benefit. 
From what I’ve explained so far about what a unit test is not and what features need to
be present for testing to be useful, I can now start to answer the primary question this
chapter poses: what is a good unit test?
1.9
Finalizing our definition
Now that I’ve covered the important properties that a unit test should have, I’ll define
unit tests once and for all:
A unit test is an automated piece of code that invokes the unit of work through an entry
point and then checks one of its exit points. A unit test is almost always written using a
unit testing framework. It can be written easily and runs quickly. It’s trustworthy,
readable, and maintainable. It is consistent as long as the production code we control has
not changed.
This definition certainly looks like a tall order, particularly considering how many
developers implement unit tests poorly. It makes us take a hard look at the way we, as
developers, have implemented testing up until now, compared to how we’d like to
implement it. (Trustworthy, readable, and maintainable tests are discussed in depth in
chapters 7 through 9.)
 In the first edition of this book, my definition of a unit test was slightly different. I
used to define a unit test as “only running against control flow code,” but I no longer
think that’s true. Code without logic is usually used as part of a unit of work. Even
properties with no logic will get used by a unit of work, so they don’t have to be specif-
ically targeted by tests.


---
**Page 22**

CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
DEFINITION
Control flow code is any piece of code that has some sort of logic in
it, small as it may be. It has one or more of the following: an if statement, a
loop, calculations, or any other type of decision-making code. 
Getters and setters are good examples of code that usually doesn’t contain any logic
and so don’t require specific targeting by the tests. It’s code that will probably get used
by the unit of work you’re testing, but there’s no need to test it directly. But watch out:
once you add any logic inside a getter or setter, you’ll want to make sure that logic is
being tested. 
 In the next section, we’ll stop talking about what is a good test and talk about when
you might want to write tests. I’ll discuss test-driven development, because it is often
put in the same bucket as doing unit testing. I want to make sure we set the record
straight on that. 
1.10
Test-driven development
Once you know how to write readable, maintainable, and trustworthy tests with a unit
testing framework, the next question is when to write the tests. Many people feel that
the best time to write unit tests for software is after they’ve created some functionality
and just before they merge their code into remote source control. 
 Also, to be a bit blunt, a lot of people don’t believe writing tests is a good idea, but
have realized through trial and error that there are strict testing requirements in
source control reviews, so they have to write tests to appease the code review gods and
get their code merged into the main branch. (That kind of dynamic is a great source
of bad tests, and I’ll address it in the third part of this book.)
 A growing number of developers prefer writing unit tests incrementally, during the
coding session and before each piece of very small functionality is implemented. This
approach is called test-first or test-driven development (TDD).
NOTE
There are many different views on exactly what test-driven develop-
ment means. Some say it’s test-first development, and some say it means you
have a lot of tests. Some say it’s a way of designing, and others feel it could be
a way to drive your code’s behavior with only some design. In this book, TDD
means test-first development, with design taking an incremental role in the
technique (besides this section, TDD won’t be discussed in this book).
Figures 1.8 and 1.9 show the differences between traditional coding and TDD. TDD is
different from traditional development, as figure 1.9 shows. You begin by writing a test
that fails; then you move on to creating the production code, seeing the test pass, and
continuing on to either refactor your code or create another failing test.
 This book focuses on the technique of writing good unit tests, rather than on
TDD, but I’m a big fan of TDD. I’ve written several major applications and frame-
works using TDD, I’ve managed teams that utilize it, and I’ve taught hundreds of
courses and workshops on TDD and unit testing techniques. Throughout my career,
I’ve found TDD to be helpful in creating quality code, quality tests, and better designs

CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
for the code I was writing. I’m convinced that it can work to your benefit, but it’s not
without a price (time to learn, time to implement, and more). It’s definitely worth the
admission price, though, if you’re willing to take on the challenge of learning it. 
1.10.1 TDD: Not a substitute for good unit tests
It’s important to realize that TDD doesn’t ensure project success or tests that are robust
or maintainable. It’s quite easy to get caught up in the technique of TDD and not pay
attention to the way unit tests are written: their naming, how maintainable or readable
they are, and whether they test the right things or might themselves have bugs. That’s
why I’m writing this book—because writing good tests is a separate skill from TDD. 
 The technique of TDD is quite simple:
1
Write a failing test to prove code or functionality is missing from the end product. The
test is written as if the production code were already working, so the test failing
means there’s a bug in the production code. How do I know? The test is written
such that it would pass if the production code had no bugs.
In some languages other than JavaScript, the test might not even compile at
first, since the code doesn’t exist yet. Once it does run, it should be failing,
because the production code is still not working. This is where a lot of the
“design” in test-driven-design thinking happens.
2
Make the test pass by adding functionality to the production code that meets the expectations
of your test. The production code should be kept as simple as possible. Don’t touch
the test. You have to make it pass only by touching production code.
3
Refactor your code. When the test passes, you’re free to move on to the next unit
test or to refactor your code (both production code and tests) to make it more
readable, to remove code duplication, and so on. This is another point where
the “design” part happens. We refactor and can even redesign our components
while still keeping the old functionality.
Refactoring steps should be very small and incremental, and we run all the
tests after each small step to make sure we didn’t break anything with our
changes. Refactoring can be done after writing several tests or after writing each
test. It’s an important practice, because it ensures your code gets easier to read
and maintain, while still passing all of the previously written tests. There’s a
whole section (8.3) on refactoring later in the book.
DEFINITION
Refactoring means changing a piece of code without changing its
functionality. If you’ve ever renamed a method, you’ve done refactoring. If
you’ve ever split a large method into multiple smaller method calls, you’ve
refactored your code. The code still does the same thing, but it becomes eas-
ier to maintain, read, debug, and change. 
The preceding steps sound technical, but there’s a lot of wisdom behind them. Done
correctly, TDD can make your code quality soar, decrease the number of bugs, raise
your confidence in the code, shorten the time it takes to find bugs, improve your code’s

Test-driven development
design, and keep your manager happier. If TDD is done incorrectly, it can cause your
project schedule to slip, waste your time, lower your motivation, and lower your code
quality. It’s a double-edged sword, and many people find this out the hard way. 
 Technically, one of the biggest benefits of TDD that nobody tells you about is that
by seeing a test fail, and then seeing it pass without changing the test, you’re basically
testing the test itself. If you expect it to fail and it passes, you might have a bug in your
test or you’re testing the wrong thing. If the test failed, you fixed it, and now you
expect it to pass, and it still fails, your test could have a bug, or maybe it’s expecting
the wrong thing to happen.
 This book deals with readable, maintainable, and trustworthy tests, but if you add
TDD on top, your confidence in your own tests will increase by seeing the failed, you
fixed it, tests failing when they should and passing when they should. In test-after style,
you’ll usually only see them pass when they should, and fail when they shouldn’t
(since the code they test should already be working). TDD helps with that a lot, and
it’s also one of the reasons developers do far less debugging when practicing TDD
than when they’re simply unit testing after the fact. If they trust the tests, they don’t
feel a need to debug it “just in case.” That’s the kind of trust you can only gain by see-
ing both sides of the test—failing when it should and passing when it should.
1.10.2 Three core skills needed for successful TDD
To be successful in test-driven development, you need three different skill sets: know-
ing how to write good tests, writing them test-first, and designing the tests and the pro-
duction code well. Figure 1.10 shows these more clearly:
Just because you write your tests first doesn’t mean they’re maintainable, readable, or trust-
worthy. Good unit testing skills are what this book is all about.
Just because you write readable, maintainable tests doesn’t mean you’ll get the same bene-
fits as when writing them test-first. Test-first skills are what most of the TDD books
out there teach, without teaching the skills of good testing. I would especially
recommend Kent Beck’s Test-Driven Development: By Example (Addison-Wesley
Professional, 2002).

CHAPTER 1
The basics of unit testing
Just because you write your tests first, and they’re readable and maintainable, doesn’t
mean you’ll end up with a well-designed system. Design skills are what make your
code beautiful and maintainable. I recommend Growing Object-Oriented Software,
Guided by Tests by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce (Addison-Wesley Professional,
2009) and Clean Code by Robert C. Martin (Pearson, 2008) as good books on the
subject.
A pragmatic approach to learning TDD is to learn each of these three aspects sepa-
rately; that is, to focus on one skill at a time, ignoring the others in the meantime. The
reason I recommend this approach is that I often see people trying to learn all three
skill sets at the same time, having a really hard time in the process, and finally giving
up because the wall is too high to climb. By taking a more incremental approach to
learning this field, you relieve yourself of the constant fear that you’re getting it wrong
in a different area than you’re currently focusing on.
 In the next chapter, you’ll start writing your first unit tests using Jest, one of the
most commonly used test frameworks for JavaScript.
Summary
A good unit test has these qualities:
– It should run quickly.
– It should have full control of the code under test.
– It should be fully isolated (it should run independently of other tests).
– It should run in memory without requiring filesystem files, networks, or
databases. 
– It should be as synchronous and linear as possible (no parallel threads).
Entry points are public functions that are the doorways into our units of work
and trigger the underlying logic. Exit points are the places you can inspect with
your test. They represent the effects of the units of work. 
An exit point can be a return value, a change of state, or a call to a third-party
dependency. Each exit point usually requires a separate test, and each type of
exit point requires a different testing technique.
A unit of work is the sum of actions that take place between the invocation of an
entry point up until a noticeable end result through one or more exit points. A
unit of work can span a function, a module, or multiple modules.
Integration testing is just unit testing with some or all of the dependencies
being real and residing outside of the current execution process. Conversely,
unit testing is like integration testing, but with all of the dependencies in mem-
ory (both real and fake), and we have control over their behavior in the test.
The most important attributes of any test are readability, maintainability, and
trust. Readability tells us how easy it is to read and understand the test. Maintain-
ability is the measure of how painful it is to maintain the test code. Without trust,

Summary
it’s harder to introduce important changes (such as refactoring) in a codebase,
which leads to code deterioration.
Test-driven development (TDD) is a technique that advocates for writing tests
before the production code. This approach is also referred to as a test-first
approach (as opposed to code-first).
The main benefit of TDD is verifying the correctness of your tests. Seeing your
tests fail before writing production code ensures that these same tests would fail
if the functionality they cover stops working properly.

A first unit test
When I first started writing unit tests with a real unit testing framework, there was
little documentation, and the frameworks I worked with didn’t have proper exam-
ples. (I was mostly coding in VB 5 and 6 at the time.) It was a challenge learning to
work with them, and I started out writing rather poor tests. Fortunately, times have
changed. In JavaScript, and in practically any language out there, there’s a wide
range of choices and plenty of documentation and support from the community
for trying out these bundles of helpfulness.
 In the previous chapter, we wrote a very simple home-grown test framework.
In this chapter, we’ll take a look at Jest, which will be our framework of choice for
this book. 
This chapter covers
Writing your first test with Jest
Test structure and naming conventions
Working with the assertion library
Refactoring tests and reducing repetitive code

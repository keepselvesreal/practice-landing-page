Ways to succeed
11.2.1 Guerrilla implementation (bottom-up)
Guerrilla-style implementation is all about starting out with a team, getting results,
and only then convincing other people that the practices are worthwhile. Usually the
driver for guerrilla implementation is a team who’s tired of doing things the pre-
scribed way. They set out to do things differently; they study on their own and make
changes happen. When the team shows results, other people in the organization may
decide to start implementing similar changes in their own teams.
 In some cases, guerrilla-style implementation is a process adopted first by develop-
ers and then by management. At other times, it’s a process advocated for first by devel-
opers and then by management. The difference is that you can accomplish the first
covertly, without the higher powers knowing about it. The latter is done in conjunc-
tion with management. It’s up to you to figure out which approach will work better.
Sometimes the only way to change things is by covert operations. Avoid this if you can,
but if there’s no other way, and you’re sure the change is needed, you can just do it.
 Don’t take this as a recommendation to make a career-limiting move. Developers
do things without permission all the time: debugging code, reading email, writing
code comments, creating flow diagrams, and so on. These are all tasks that developers
do as a regular part of the job. The same goes for unit testing. Most developers already
write tests of some sort (automated or not). The idea is to redirect the time spent on
tests into something that will provide benefits in the long term.
11.2.2 Convincing management (top-down)
The top-down move usually starts in one of two ways. A manager or a developer will
initiate the process and start the rest of the organization moving in that direction,
piece by piece. Or a mid-level manager may see a presentation, read a book (such as
this one), or talk to a colleague about the benefits of specific changes to the way they
work. Such a manager will usually initiate the process by giving a presentation to peo-
ple in other teams or even using their authority to make the change happen.
11.2.3 Experiments as door openers
Here’s a powerful way to get started with unit testing in a large organization (it could
also fit other types of transformation or new skills). Declare an experiment that will
last two to three months. It will apply to only one pre-picked team and relate to only
one or two components in a real application. Make sure it’s not too risky. If it fails, the
company won’t go under or lose a major client. It also shouldn’t be useless: the exper-
iment must provide real value and not just serve as a playground. It has to be some-
thing you’ll end up pushing into your codebase and use in production eventually; it
shouldn’t be a write-and-forget piece of code.
 The word “experiment” conveys that the change is temporary, and if it doesn’t
work out, the team can go back to the way they were before. Also, the effort is time-
boxed, so we know when the experiment is finished.

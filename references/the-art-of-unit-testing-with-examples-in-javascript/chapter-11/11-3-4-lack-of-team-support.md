Integrating unit testing into the organization
11.3.4 Lack of team support
If your team doesn’t support your efforts, it will be nearly impossible to succeed,
because you’ll have a hard time consolidating your extra work on the new process with
your regular work. You should strive to have your team be part of the new process or at
least not interfere with it. 
 Talk to your team members about the changes. Getting their support one by one is
sometimes a good way to start, but talking to them as a group about your efforts—and
answering their hard questions—can also prove valuable. Whatever you do, don’t take
the team’s support for granted. Make sure you know what you’re getting into; these
are the people you have to work with on a daily basis.

Influence factors
I’ve written and covered influencing behaviors as a full chapter in my book Elastic
Leadership (Manning, 2016). If you find this topic interesting, I recommend picking
that one up, or reading more about it at 5whys.com. 
 One of the things I find even more fascinating than unit tests is people and why
they behave the way they do. It can be very frustrating to try to get someone to start
doing something (like TDD, for example), and regardless of your best efforts, they
just won’t do it. You may have already tried reasoning with them, but you see they
don’t do anything in response to your little talk. 
 In the book Influencer: The Power to Change Anything (McGraw-Hill, 2007) by Kerry
Patterson, Joseph Grenny, David Maxfield, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler, you’ll find
the following mantra (paraphrased):
For every behavior that you see, the world is perfectly designed for that behavior to
happen. That means that there are other factors besides the person wanting to do
something or being able to do it that influence their behavior. Yet we rarely look beyond
those two factors.
The book exposes us to six influence factors:
Personal ability—Does the person have all the skills or knowledge to perform
what is required? 
Personal motivation—Does the person take satisfaction from the right behavior
or dislike the wrong behavior? Do they have the self-control to engage in the
behavior when it’s hardest to do so?
Social ability—Do you or others provide the help, information, and resources
required by that person, particularly at critical times?
Social motivation—Are the people around them actively encouraging the right
behavior and discouraging the wrong behavior? Are you or others modeling the
right behavior in an effective way?
Structural (environmental) ability—Are there aspects in the environment (build-
ing, budget, and so on) that make the behavior convenient, easy, and safe? Are
there enough cues and reminders to stay on course?

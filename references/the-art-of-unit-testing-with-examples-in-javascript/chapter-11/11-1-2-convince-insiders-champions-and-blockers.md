CHAPTER 11
Integrating unit testing into the organization
accountable) for what’s happening, whether or not you want them to, and there’s no
use in hiding. In fact, hiding can cause things to go terribly wrong.
 As you start to implement or push for changes, people will start asking tough ques-
tions related to what they care about. How much time will this “waste”? What does this
mean for me as a QA engineer? How do we know it works? Be prepared to answer. The
answers to the most common questions are discussed in section 11.5. You’ll find that
convincing others inside the organization before you start making changes will help
you immensely when you need to make tough decisions and answer those questions.
 Finally, someone will have to stay at the helm, making sure the changes don’t die
for lack of momentum. That’s you. There are ways to keep things alive, as you’ll see in
the next sections.
11.1.1 Be prepared for the tough questions
Do your research. Read the questions and answers at the end of this chapter, and look
at the related resources. Read forums, mailing lists, and blogs, and consult with your
peers. If you can answer your own tough questions, there’s a good chance you can
answer someone else’s.
11.1.2 Convince insiders: Champions and blockers
Few things make you feel as lonely in an organization as the decision to go against the
current. If you’re the only one who thinks what you’re doing is a good idea, there’s lit-
tle reason for anyone to make an effort to implement what you’re advocating. Con-
sider who can help and hurt your efforts: the champions and blockers.
CHAMPIONS
As you start pushing for change, identify the people you think are most likely to help
in your quest. They’ll be your champions. They’re usually early adopters, or people who
are open minded enough to try the things you’re advocating. They may already be
half convinced but are looking for an impetus to start the change. They may have even
tried it and failed on their own.
 Approach them before anyone else and ask for their opinions on what you’re
about to do. They may tell you some things that you hadn’t considered, including 
Teams that might be good candidates to start with 
Places where people are more accepting of such changes 
What (and who) to watch out for in your quest
By approaching them, you’re helping to ensure that they’re part of the process. Peo-
ple who feel part of the process usually try to help make it work. Make them your
champions: ask them if they can help you and be the ones people can come to with
questions. Prepare them for such events.
BLOCKERS
Next, identify the blockers. These are the people in the organization who are most
likely to resist the changes you’re making. For example, a manager might object to

11.1
Steps to becoming an agent of change
adding unit tests, claiming that they’ll add too much time to the development effort
and increase the amount of code that needs to be maintained. Make them part of the
process instead of resisters of it by giving them (at least those who are willing and
able) an active role in the process.
 The reasons why people might resist changes vary. Answers to some of the possible
objections are covered in section 11.4 on influence forces. Some will be worried about
job security, and some will just feel too comfortable with the way things currently are.
Approaching potential blockers and detailing all the things they could have done bet-
ter is often not constructive, as I’ve found out the hard way. People don’t like to be
told that their baby is ugly. 
 Instead, ask blockers to help you in the process by being in charge of defining cod-
ing standards for unit tests, for example, or by doing code and test reviews with peers
every other day. Or make them part of the team that chooses the course materials or
outside consultants. You’ll give them a new responsibility that will help them feel
relied on and relevant in the organization. They need to be part of the change or
they’ll almost certainly undermine it.
11.1.3 Identify possible starting points
Identify where in the organization you can start implementing changes. Most success-
ful implementations take a steady route. Start with a pilot project in a small team, and
see what happens. If all goes well, move on to other teams and other projects.
 Here are some tips that will help you along the way:
Choose smaller teams.
Create subteams.
Consider project feasibility.
Use code and test reviews as teaching tools.
These tips can take you a long way in a mostly hostile environment.
CHOOSE SMALLER TEAMS
Identifying possible teams to start with is usually easy. You’ll generally want a small
team working on a low-profile project with low risks. If the risk is minimal, it’s easier to
convince people to try your proposed changes. 
 One caveat is that the team needs to have members who are open to changing the
way they work and to learning new skills. Ironically, the people with less experience on
a team are usually most likely to be open to change, and people with more experience
tend to be more entrenched in their way of doing things. If you can find a team with
an experienced leader who’s open to change, but that also includes less-experienced
developers, it’s likely that team will offer little resistance. Go to the team and ask their
opinion on holding a pilot project. They’ll tell you if this is (or is not) the right place
to start.

CHAPTER 11
Integrating unit testing into the organization
Skills—Track that we are slowly removing knowledge barriers inside teams or
across teams
Learning—Acting like we’re a learning organization
QUALITATIVE METRICS
The metrics are mostly quantitative (i.e., they are numbers that can be measured), but
a few are qualitative, in that you ask people how they feel or think about something.
The ones I use are
How confident you are that the tests can and will find bugs in the code if they
arise (from 1 to 5)? Take the average of the responses from the team members
or across multiple teams.
Does the code do what it is supposed to do (from 1 to 5)?
These are surveys you can ask at each retrospective meeting, and they take five min-
utes to answer. 
TREND LINES ARE YOUR FRIEND
For all leading and lagging indicators, you want to see trend lines, not just snapshots of
numbers. Lines over time is how you see if you’re getting better or worse. 
 Don’t fall into the trap of having a nice dashboard with large numbers on it. Num-
bers without context are not good or bad. Trend lines tell you if you’re better this
week than you were last week. 
11.2.7 Realize that there will be hurdles
There are always hurdles. Most will come from within the organizational structure,
and some will be technical. The technical ones are easier to fix, because it’s a matter
of finding the right solution. The organizational ones need care and attention and a
psychological approach.
 It’s important not to surrender to a feeling of temporary failure when an iteration
goes bad, tests go slower than expected, and so on. It’s sometimes hard to get going,
and you’ll need to persist for at least a couple of months to start feeling comfortable
with the new process and to iron out all the kinks. Have management commit to con-
tinuing for at least three months even if things don’t go as planned. It’s important to
get their agreement up front. You don’t want to be running around trying to convince
people in the middle of a stressful first month.
 Also, absorb this short realization, shared by Tim Ottinger on Twitter (@Tottinge):
“If your tests don’t catch all defects, they still make it easier to fix the defects they
didn’t catch. It is a profound truth.”
 Now that we’ve looked at ways of ensuring things go right, let’s look at some things
that can lead to failure.
11.3
Ways to fail
In the preface to this book, I talked about one project I was involved with that failed,
partly because unit testing wasn’t implemented correctly. That’s one way a project can

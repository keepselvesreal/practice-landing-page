11.3
Ways to fail
fail. I’ll discuss several others here, along with one that cost me that project, and some
things that can be done about them.
11.3.1 Lack of a driving force
In the places where I’ve seen change fail, the lack of a driving force was the most pow-
erful factor in play. Being a consistent driving force of change has its price. It will take
time away from your normal job to teach others, help them, and wage internal politi-
cal wars for change. You need to be willing to surrender time for these tasks, or the
change won’t happen. Bringing in an outside person, as mentioned in section 11.2.4,
will help you in your quest for a consistent driving force.
11.3.2 Lack of political support
If your boss explicitly tells you not to make the change, there isn’t a whole lot you can
do, besides trying to convince management to see what you see. But sometimes the
lack of support is much more subtle than that, and the trick is to realize that you’re
facing opposition. 
 For example, you may be told, “Sure, go ahead and implement those tests. We’re
adding 10% to your time to do this.” Anything below 30% isn’t realistic for beginning
a unit testing effort. This is one way a manager may try to stop a trend—by choking it
out of existence. 
 You need to recognize that you’re facing opposition, but once you know what to
look for, it’s easy to identify. When you tell them that their limitations aren’t realistic,
you’ll be told, “So don’t do it.”
11.3.3 Ad hoc implementations and first impressions
If you’re planning to implement unit testing without prior knowledge of how to write
good unit tests, do yourself one big favor: involve someone who has experience and
follow good practices (such as those outlined in this book). 
 I’ve seen developers jump into the deep water without a proper understanding of
what to do or where to start, and that’s not a good place to be. Not only will it take a
huge amount of time to learn how to make changes that are acceptable for your situa-
tion, but you’ll also lose a lot of credibility along the way for starting out with a bad
implementation. This can lead to the pilot project being shut down.
 If you read this book’s preface, you’ll know that this happened to me. You have
only a couple of months to get things up to speed and convince the higher-ups that
you’re achieving results with experiments. Make that time count, and remove any risks
that you can. If you don’t know how to write good tests, read a book or get a consul-
tant. If you don’t know how to make your code testable, do the same. Don’t waste time
reinventing testing methods.

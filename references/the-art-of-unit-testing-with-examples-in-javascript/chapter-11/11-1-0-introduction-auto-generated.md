Integrating unit testing
into the organization
As a consultant, I’ve helped several companies, big and small, integrate continuous
delivery processes and various engineering practices, such as test-driven develop-
ment and unit testing, into their organizational culture. Sometimes this has failed,
but those companies that succeeded had several things in common. In any type of
organization, changing people’s habits is more psychological than technical. Peo-
ple don’t like change, and change is usually accompanied with plenty of FUD (fear,
uncertainty, and doubt) to go around. It won’t be a walk in the park for most peo-
ple, as you’ll see in this chapter.

Steps to becoming an agent of change
If you’re going to be the agent of change in your organization, you should first
accept that role. People will view you as the person responsible (and sometimes

accountable) for what’s happening, whether or not you want them to, and there’s no
use in hiding. In fact, hiding can cause things to go terribly wrong.
 As you start to implement or push for changes, people will start asking tough ques-
tions related to what they care about. How much time will this “waste”? What does this
mean for me as a QA engineer? How do we know it works? Be prepared to answer. The
answers to the most common questions are discussed in section 11.5. You’ll find that
convincing others inside the organization before you start making changes will help
you immensely when you need to make tough decisions and answer those questions.
 Finally, someone will have to stay at the helm, making sure the changes don’t die
for lack of momentum. That’s you. There are ways to keep things alive, as you’ll see in
the next sections.
11.1.1 Be prepared for the tough questions
Do your research. Read the questions and answers at the end of this chapter, and look
at the related resources. Read forums, mailing lists, and blogs, and consult with your
peers. If you can answer your own tough questions, there’s a good chance you can
answer someone else’s.
11.1.2 Convince insiders: Champions and blockers
Few things make you feel as lonely in an organization as the decision to go against the
current. If you’re the only one who thinks what you’re doing is a good idea, there’s lit-
tle reason for anyone to make an effort to implement what you’re advocating. Con-
sider who can help and hurt your efforts: the champions and blockers.
CHAMPIONS
As you start pushing for change, identify the people you think are most likely to help
in your quest. They’ll be your champions. They’re usually early adopters, or people who
are open minded enough to try the things you’re advocating. They may already be
half convinced but are looking for an impetus to start the change. They may have even
tried it and failed on their own.
 Approach them before anyone else and ask for their opinions on what you’re
about to do. They may tell you some things that you hadn’t considered, including 
Teams that might be good candidates to start with 
Places where people are more accepting of such changes 
What (and who) to watch out for in your quest
By approaching them, you’re helping to ensure that they’re part of the process. Peo-
ple who feel part of the process usually try to help make it work. Make them your
champions: ask them if they can help you and be the ones people can come to with
questions. Prepare them for such events.
BLOCKERS
Next, identify the blockers. These are the people in the organization who are most
likely to resist the changes you’re making. For example, a manager might object to

[ 7 ]
In this chapter, we will cover the following:
Introducing software testing and quality control
Introducing automatic tests and test suites
Introducing test-driven development and unit tests
Understanding integration and functional tests
Understanding the testing pyramid and trophy
Technical requirements
A working Python interpreter is all that's needed.
The examples have been written in Python 3.7 but should work in most modern Python
versions.

Introducing software testing and quality
control
From the early days, it was clear that like any other machine, software needed a way to 
verify it was working properly and was built with no defects.
Software development processes have been heavily inspired by manufacturing industry
standards, and early on, testing and quality control were introduced into the product
development life cycle. So software companies frequently have a quality assurance team
that focuses on setting up processes to guarantee robust software and track results.
Those processes usually include a quality control process where the quality of the built
artifact is assessed before it can be considered ready for users.
The quality control process usually achieves such confidence through the execution of a test
plan. This is usually a checklist that a dedicated team goes through during the various
phases of production to ensure the software behaves as expected.

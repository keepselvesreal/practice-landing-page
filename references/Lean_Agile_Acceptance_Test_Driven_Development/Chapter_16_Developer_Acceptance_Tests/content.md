Line 7: The triad has developed acceptance tests for stories that Cathy created. When a 
Line 8: developer needs a component from another developer, the requester should cre-
Line 9: ate acceptance tests for that component. 
Line 10: Component Acceptance Tests 
Line 11: Acceptance tests are not generated by just the customer unit. Many software 
Line 12: development organizations have groups that develop common modules or com-
Line 13: ponents for other groups. The requesting group needs to supply acceptance tests 
Line 14: for those modules. 
Line 15: Field Display Tests 
Line 16: For example, specialized developers often create custom user interface compo-
Line 17: nents. User interface developers use these components in web pages. Let’s look 
Line 18: at a couple of common components. One is a text box that accepts a format-
Line 19: ted string, such as a phone number or an e-mail address. The other is a tabular 
Line 20: style–component that allows sorting by the values in columns. The tests may 
Line 21: look like speciﬁcations or vice versa. 
Line 22: Cathy wants a ﬁeld on the display for entering a phone number. Obviously, 
Line 23: you should check the data entered into the ﬁeld for validity. The format differs 
Line 24: between nations; so to keep it simple, the example shows a U.S. phone number. 
Line 25: The N in the table means a number or a digit.

Line 51: Suppose Don is the developer who is going to create this component. The ﬁrst 
Line 52: thing Debbie needs to do is give an acceptance test for what it should look like. 
Line 53: For example, will it display the dashes immediately or as a person types the dig-
Line 54: its? Let’s suppose the former. Debbie creates an image of what the component 
Line 55: should look like in Figure 16.1. The image is part of the acceptance test, but one 
Line 56: you have to verify manually. You also need to check the color and font. 2
Line 57: Phone Number
Line 58: 1-999-999-9999
Line 59: Figure 16.1 State Diagram 
Line 60: Debbie also needs to specify to Don what should occur if the phone number 
Line 61: is incorrectly formatted. Should the component just return a failure code? Or 
Line 62: should the component produce an output as a beep or error message? Since the 
Line 63: phone number box will be used repeatedly on every form that requires one, this 
Line 64: decision may need to be made by a corporate user interface standards group. 
Line 65: Suppose Cathy wants the error to be displayed when the user ﬁnishes an entry 
Line 66: in the ﬁeld. So Debbie constructs a table that describes how the error should 
Line 67: appear.
Line 68: 2. A test process could include a step in which the customer approves the image that 
Line 69: an application generates. That image could be used in a test to ensure that it did not 
Line 70: change.

Line 96: Don creates a form with a Phone Number ﬁeld on it and a Submit button. He 
Line 97: then demonstrates to Debbie that the component passes the tests for both a valid 
Line 98: and an invalid entry. Next, he shows that the ﬁeld sends the correct informa-
Line 99: tion when the Submit button is pressed. He also devises a form with three entry 
Line 100: ﬁelds—one prior to the Phone Number ﬁeld and one after it—and a Submit but-
Line 101: ton. He demonstrates that the ﬁeld works with other entry ﬁelds by allowing the 
Line 102: user to tab to the next and previous entries. 
Line 103: This component is a user interface component, so there will be some manual 
Line 104: tests to ensure that it is acceptable to a human being. You can create automated 
Line 105: tests to check that the component continues to work even if you change its 
Line 106: underlying implementation. 
Line 107: Tabular Display Tests 
Line 108: Here’s a display component that is more complicated. A user interface often 
Line 109: contains a table of items. The table component might allow the user to sort the 
Line 110: table by the values in each column, or it may have links within the table. Cathy 
Line 111: or Debbie needs to determine what should be displayed if there are no values in 
Line 112: the data to be shown in the table and what to do if the number of values is large. 
Line 113: Here are some potential inputs to a table display. It doesn’t matter whether 
Line 114: these values come from a program component, such as a Java class, or a data-
Line 115: base query. That’s a matter of connecting up the table to the appropriate code. 
Line 116: The ﬁrst input is a simple set of data.

Line 151: Debbie and Don need to clarify the contract for the table display component. 
Line 152: Should it be Debbie’s job to ensure that the component never gets passed an 
Line 153: empty table or a really big table, or should it be the component’s responsibility 
Line 154: to handle these cases? If the latter, Debbie needs to create some tests for these

Line 31: store, and Cary, who clerks in the store, are there as potential users. Debbie and 
Line 32: Tom, representing the development and test units, participate as well. 
Line 33: The purpose of the meeting is to create a project charter. A charter can include 
Line 34: many sections, such as vision, mission, scope, deliverables, objectives, and prin-
Line 35: ciples [Wiegers03] [Wiegers04]. The vision describes the end-state of the result 
Line 36: of the project—why the project should be done. The mission involves the path 
Line 37: that will be taken to get to the vision. The scope documents the boundaries of 
Line 38: the project, including the key events that the project addresses. The deliverables
Line 39: are the tangible outputs. The objectives are measurable criteria for the success 
Line 40: of the project that are visible by external observation. Principles are statement 
Line 41: of values that a team uses to inform decision making. Other sections can include 
Line 42: stakeholders (those affected by the project), project organization, plans for 
Line 43: implementations, risks, and constraints. 
Line 44: Examples of a charter’s vision, mission, principles, and objectives are shown 
Line 45: in this chapter. Posting these sections of the charter on the project board helps 
Line 46: keep everyone focused. The charter meeting involves more than just Sam and 
Line 47: Cathy so that everyone can get an idea of the big picture, understand the issues 
Line 48: involved, and agree that the project’s objectives are feasible. 
Line 49: Sam starts by presenting his vision for the project. He wants to eliminate 
Line 50: waste in the rental process and offer more services to customers. The discussion 
Line 51: then starts revolving around objectives. 
Line 52: Objectives
Line 53: Objectives should be SMART. SMART is an acronym that has many interpreta-
Line 54: tions [Project01]. In the version here, SMART means 
Line 55: • Speciﬁ c—Exactly what is going to be accomplished, or what is the speciﬁc 
Line 56: outcome?
Line 57: • Measurable—Can the outcome be measured? 
Line 58: • Achievable—Can the outcome reasonably be accomplished? 
Line 59: • Relevant—Does the outcome support the vision? 
Line 60: • Time boxed—How long will it take to achieve the objective? 
Line 61: Without detailing who-says-what-when, the sponsor, customer, and users 
Line 62: (Sam, Cathy, Mary, Harry, and Cary) usually propose objectives. If Debbie and 
Line 63: Tom (the developer/tester units) think that an objective is not achievable within 
Line 64: the time box, the objective misses the “A” part of SMART. The measurement 
Line 65: or the time box has to be changed so that the objective is agreed upon, or the

Line 71: SMART objectives listed in the following sidebar. 
Line 72: Vision, Mission, Objective, and Principles of a Charter 
Line 73: Vision
Line 74: •  The rental process creates minimum waste and offers more services 
Line 75: to customers.
Line 76: Mission
Line 77: •  Create a custom software package.
Line 78: Objectives
Line 79: • Within two months after project initiation, clerks will spend 50% 
Line 80: less time per transaction on both CD check-outs and returns. 
Line 81: • Within three months after project initiation, customers will be able 
Line 82: to reserve CDs prior to renting them.
Line 83: Principles
Line 84: •  Customer satisfaction is of primary importance. 
Line 85: •  Clerk convenience is secondary. 
Line 86:  
Line 87: Project Acceptance Tests 
Line 88: The objectives are the acceptance tests for the overall project. 1 The ﬁrst objective 
Line 89: requires that the current amount of time it takes to process a CD be measured. 2
Line 90: In two months, the time will be measured again. If the second measurement is 
Line 91: not 50% less than the ﬁrst measurement, the test has failed and the objective has 
Line 92: not been met. Did the project still produce business value by reducing the time? 
Line 93: Yes. But it did not deliver the full business value, which is why the project was 
Line 94: approved.
Line 95: Even if the full effect was achieved, but not within the speciﬁed time box 
Line 96: of two months, getting the business value was delayed. This delay reduces the 
Line 97: return on investment (ROI) received from the project. 
Line 98:   1 . Objectives are also related to management tests. See [III01]. 
Line 99:   2 . This could be more detailed, giving the exact events that make up the process time, 
Line 100: such as from a customer handing the clerk the CD to the clerk handing the customer 
Line 101: the rental contract.

Line 106: A Simple Objective 
Line 107: A $200 million project had a simple objective: It was deﬁned by the 
Line 108: following:
Line 109: •  70mpg
Line 110: This was the objective for the Honda Insight: a new hybrid vehicle. The 
Line 111: single focus drove the engineering design. When engineers needed to make 
Line 112: a decision, they consulted the objective. Cutting weight is a large factor in 
Line 113: increasing mileage. You might imagine the discussions: 
Line 114: “Seatbelts? Well, they weigh three pounds. Delete them.” There were 
Line 115: implicit constraints. The car had to be sellable at least. 
Line 116: “Air conditioning? It takes 2mpg. Skip it.” The 2 miles per gallon would 
Line 117: count against the mileage if air conditioning was factory installed. So the 
Line 118: dealers had to install it. 
Line 119: The total capacity was 365 pounds. That is the total for two people and 
Line 120: cargo.
Line 121: The goal was not to sell a lot of cars, but to make the mileage objective. 
Line 122: And they did it. 
Line 123: P.S. Do you know what the charter objectives for your project are? 
Line 124: Objectives Should Be Measurable 
Line 125: A project at one company had the purpose of making its website more user 
Line 126: friendly so that people would stay there longer, thus increasing the pos-
Line 127: sibility that the people would buy more products and drive revenue. The 
Line 128: company started with an objective that read something like this: 
Line 129: •  Within six months, the site should be more user friendly. 
Line 130: The issue with this objective as it stands is that it is practically subjec-
Line 131: tive. It needs to be stated in measureable terms. The measurement must 
Line 132: be relevant to the goal. There are many ways to perform measurements, 
Line 133: such as the time it takes for a user to perform certain operations. Detailed 
Line 134: measurements can help determine why a particular program is or is not 
Line 135: user friendly. But for purposes of a simple high-level measurement, you 
Line 136: might use a survey, such as the System Usability Scale (a measure of 0 to 
Line 137: 
Line 138: --- 페이지 66 ---
Line 139: High-Level Requirements 
Line 140: 43
Line 141: You can create a mini-charter for each release of a project. The mini-charter 
Line 142: may include a vision and the objectives for that release. The time boxes for the 
Line 143: objectives usually correspond to the release schedule. If an objective cannot be 
Line 144: met during the release time box, it could be split into subobjectives, each of 
Line 145: which is achievable within the schedule. 
Line 146: High-Level Requirements 
Line 147: A business must have capabilities to run. In Sam’s case, the capabilities include 
Line 148: keeping track of CDs and collecting payment for rentals. The capabilities today 
Line 149: are implemented through manual features—a set of paper index cards and a 
Line 150: cash register. The new system will have features that provide these capabilities. 
Line 151: High-level requirements are usually gathered at the feature level (see Figure 5.2).

Line 174: he does not have an investment in the outcome. For a few minutes, he has all 
Line 175: the participants individually write down ideas for features, one per index card. 
Line 176: Tom suggests that people not hold back on their thoughts. They should write 
Line 177: down any ideas they can imagine that may pertain to the charter. Out-of-scope 
Line 178: ideas will be eliminated later when the ideas are matched to the objectives of the 
Line 179: charter.
Line 180: The team members then place their cards on the table and match ideas that 
Line 181: are almost the same. If there are natural groupings, they place the cards close to 
Line 182: each other. The ideas that were grouped together show up beneath the overall 
Line 183: idea. The results are as follows: 
Line 184: Feature List 
Line 185: • Check out and check in 
Line 186: • Reservation system for CDs 
Line 187: • CD catalog of all CDs so renters can select ones to rent or reserve 
Line 188: • For multiple stores, a way to return a CD to any store 
Line 189: • For multiple stores, a way to determine which stores have
Line 190: particular CDs 
Line 191: • Credit card charging to eliminate cash 
Line 192: • Hookup with a video rental store to offer combined reservations 
Line 193: • Have a party for customers who rent lots of CDs that month 
Line 194: The ideas need to be whittled down. The group came up with ideas related 
Line 195: to Sam’s expansion plans, not the current objectives. The customer unit needs 
Line 196: to decide which features help achieve the objectives and thus should be part of 
Line 197: the scope of the project. After some discussion, the group came up with the fol-
Line 198: lowing features: 
Line 199: • Reservation system for CDs 
Line 200: • Check out and check in 
Line 201: • Credit card charging to eliminate cash 
Line 202: The remaining ideas are not tossed away. They are captured for revisiting 
Line 203: once the selected features are implemented.

Line 206: High-Level Requirements 
Line 207: 45
Line 208: Feature Acceptance Criteria 
Line 209: Now that the features are selected, the entire team examines them to see what 
Line 210: the high-level acceptance criteria are for each of them. As a tester, Tom has valu-
Line 211: able input into this process. If the team cannot come up with a high-level idea 
Line 212: of how to check that a feature is implemented correctly, the feature needs more 
Line 213: deﬁnition. Working together, the team comes up with the following: 
Line 214: Feature Acceptance Criteria 
Line 215: Check out and check-in 
Line 216: • Check out a CD; make sure the details are correct and it’s recorded 
Line 217: as rented. 
Line 218: • Check in a CD; make sure that any late rental fees are computed and 
Line 219: that it’s recorded as returned. 
Line 220: Credit card charging to eliminate cash 
Line 221: •  Check out a CD and see if a charge is recorded. 
Line 222: •  Check in a CD and see if late rental fees are charged.
Line 223: Reservation system for CDs 
Line 224: •  Reserve a CD and see if a reserver is notiﬁed when a CD becomes 
Line 225: available.
Line 226: Now that the features are agreed upon, the developers and testers determine 
Line 227: a high-level estimate for them to see if they can be implemented to achieve the 
Line 228: objective within the speciﬁed time box 5 If not, the project needs review. 
Line 229: The team then plans the sequence and schedule for the features. The means 
Line 230: for doing so depend on the development process. The developer/tester units 
Line 231: could estimate the features and schedule them into iterations. 6 Or the items 
Line 232: could be placed in a work queue and the developer/tester units could work on 
Line 233: the highest item in that queue until it was ﬁnished. 7 Estimating, sequencing, and 
Line 234: scheduling are covered in detail in other books, as [Shalloway01] and [Cohn01]. 
Line 235: 5. Some teams do a high-level business value estimate to determine a high-level ROI for 
Line 236: each feature. This ROI can help in planning. 
Line 237: 6. Such as in Scrum [Pichler01]. 
Line 238: 7. Such as in Kanban [Anderson01].
